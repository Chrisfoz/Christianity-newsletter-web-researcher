## Peel Police Department's New Model of Community Engagement

In Toronto, Canada, the Peel Police Department has been shifting from a "warrior mentality" to that of "guardians" in its approach to law enforcement. This new model emphasizes diversity and active collaboration with the community. As part of this initiative, the department will host its second annual Police Religious Literacy program, deepening officers' understanding of the ethno-religious communities they serve. Such steps reflect a growing recognition of the importance of religious literacy in promoting peace and understanding in diverse societies.
