We encountered it at our site visits where guests were humbled by our hosts, through the generous labour of our volunteers to make the program go, of course, in the man who initiated this amazing event, our founder JW Windland. At the link , I want to share with you some moments and actions that stood out.\nPhoto credit: Encounter World Religions\nOther Stories\nLiberalizing and Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia\nAlice Evans is a fascinating researcher on women's rights who uses Big Data and cross-cultural comparison to try to determine what factors lead to fairer societies for women. This article of hers is outstanding. She makes the case that Saudi Arabia is liberalizing somewhat dramatically and that this will have implications far beyond the Arabian peninsula due to the country's impact on the larger Muslim world. I found both what she says and how she is trying to track these cultural changes really interesting. Give it a read.\nPhoto credit: Screenshot IMDB show web page.\nChinese Government Forcing the Removal of Religious Objects from Tibetan Homes\nAs the Chinese government continues to try to change Tibetan culture to fit with the desires of the state, the government is now banning certain online prayers and forcing Tibetans in some villages to remove religious objects like prayer flags from their homes. Religious freedom is always a good marker for whether freedom more broadly is protected. It is disheartening to see this relentless decades-long attempt to erase a culture.\nPhoto credit: Canva.com\nPeel Police Shifting from Warrior Mentality to that of Guardians\nPeel is a suburb of Toronto where the police chief is working hard to foster a new mentality and new methods to create a more diverse workforce that partners thoroughly with the community. I found this piece especially interesting because at Encounter, we will be holding our second annual Police Religious Literacy program at Peel's headquarters this November. The 3 day program aims at helping officers gain greater literacy about the ethno-religious communities they serve and I can see now why Peel was so receptive to hosting the event.\nPhoto credit: Screenshot IMDB show web page.\nWhat's Encounter Up To?\nWelcoming Workplace\n(August 21) - [Closed] - Federated Cooperatives - We will explore how religious literacy can foster workplace inclusion that benefits staff productivity, happiness, and retention.\nWelcoming Workplace\n(August 22) - [Closed] - Indiegogo - In this session with the US-based tech company Indiegogo, we will discuss why religious literacy is so critical in today's diverse societies and how workplaces can create a sense of belonging that allows people to bring their full selves to work.\nReligious Literacy and Organ Donation\n(September 11-12) - [Closed] - Gift of Hope, Chicago - We will learn how different religious communities approach issues around death, dying and donation. By better understanding how these issues are understood, Gift of Hope aspires to increase the rate of donation and to save lives.\nThe Israeli-Palestinian Conflict\n(September 16) - [Closed] - Third Age Learning - York Region - We will explore the history of the land and its two peoples to better understand the current conflict.

We have offered this program many times with Road Scholar and the reviews have been excellent. Come join us!\nReligion: The Big Questions\n(October 22 - December 3) - [ Open ] - Beaver Valley Lifelong Learning - We will explore central questions around religion like why do some feel the presence of God or spirits while others do not; why are some countries very religious and others are not; how does religion connect to politics and influence society; and we will explore unique aspects of American religiosity. Join us!\nDemystifying Hinduism\n(October 23) - [Closed] - Region of Peel - Hinduism is one of the largest religions on earth and is growing rapidly in Canada. In this session, we will explore some of the basics of Hinduism, misconceptions, and how to foster inclusion in our work cultures and in interacting with the community.\nInclusion and Religious Holidays\n(November 7) - [Closed] - Federated Cooperatives - We will explore how religious holidays can foster workplace inclusion that benefits staff productivity, happiness, and retention.\nIf you are interested in learning more about how religious literacy can impact your organization, help you support and retain your staff, and attract new customers, please reach out or visit our Workplace programs page for more information.\nCopyright © 2024 ReligionsGeek, All rights reserved.\nWant to change how you receive these emails?\nYou can update your preferences or unsubscribe from this list."
