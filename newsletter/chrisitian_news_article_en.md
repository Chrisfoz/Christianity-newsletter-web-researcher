# Embracing Technology: AI's Impact on Global Christianity

Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to shape various aspects of life, including how Christians engage with their faith. Recent developments across the globe highlight both the enthusiastic adoption and cautious approach Christians are taking towards AI, reflecting a balance of optimism and concern about the role technology plays in spiritual life.

## A Global Christian Experience Powered by AI

On March 1, 2025, Gather25 aimed to bring 2.5 billion Christians together in a simultaneous prayer and worship event that spanned 25 hours and included participants from 225 countries ([Premier Christian News](https://premierchristian.news/us/news/article/ai-event-to-connect-all-2-5-billion-christians-in-simultaneous-prayer-and-worship)). Utilizing AI translation technology, the event was emblematic of using artificial intelligence to transcend geographic and linguistic barriers, allowing live worship and teaching in 87 languages.

Initiatives like Gather25 underline the potential of AI to facilitate large-scale Christian events, fostering a sense of global unity and shared purpose. As Jennie Allen, the visionary behind Gather25, articulated, AI enables the church to act collectively on a scale previously unimaginable.

## The Church Navigating Ethical Boundaries with AI

While AI holds promise for enhancing church operations and outreach, it brings to the fore ethical concerns, particularly regarding content creation and spiritual authenticity. A significant number of pastors and church leaders are engaging in an earnest debate about AI's place within the church context ([Episcopal News Service](https://episcopalnewsservice.org/2025/09/05/faith-leaders-bring-ethical-concerns-curiosity-to-ai-debate-at-multi-denominational-conference/)).

At the Faithful Futures conference, religious leaders from different denominations addressed questions of how AI could both aid and potentially disrupt traditional Christian practices. Discussions underscored a consensus that AI should support spiritual beliefs, not replace them, emphasizing the need for a measured approach to integrating technology in ministry.

## AI in Worship and Sermon Preparation

AI's integration into ministry appears varied. According to a study, nearly two-thirds of pastors now use AI for sermon preparation, with tools like ChatGPT and Grammarly becoming go-to resources for many ([Christian Post](https://www.christianpost.com/news/majority-of-pastors-using-ai-to-prepare-sermons-study.html)). However, there remains a focus on ethical considerations, such as maintaining theological accuracy and ensuring that AI doesn't overshadow human spiritual guidance.

Despite the practical benefits, church leaders like Kevin Uhrich caution against AI-generated worship content, stressing the irreplaceable personal touch and spiritual inspiration. The cautionary stance is not born out of technophobia but from the desire to uphold the sanctity and authenticity of worship music and sermons ([Religion Unplugged](https://religionunplugged.com/news/2026/1/3/as-ai-music-climbs-the-charts-church-leaders-urge-caution-and-discernment)).

## AI: A Tool for Growth or a Path to Isolation?

Discussions about AI in Christianity inevitably circle back to its role in enhancing or diminishing human connections within the church. While technology can streamline operations and outreach, there is anxiety about AI-induced isolation—cases where believers might turn to AI for spiritual companionship and guidance over human fellowship.

Companies like Gloo are navigating this space by creating AI applications tailored specifically to Christian contexts, promising guidance rooted in scriptural and denominational tenets, while also promoting involvement in local church communities ([Christianity Today](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/gloo-ai-artificial-intelligence-church-worship-tech-ethics/)).

## Conclusion

AI is rapidly becoming an integral part of church life, offering opportunities for growth and outreach, while also inviting scrutiny about its ethical ramifications. As churches navigate this new frontier, the key will be striking a balance—leveraging AI's capabilities to support rather than replace traditional, spirit-led processes, ensuring that technology serves as a bridge, not a barrier, in the shared journey of faith.
