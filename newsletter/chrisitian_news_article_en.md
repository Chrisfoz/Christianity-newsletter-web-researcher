# AI and the Church: Navigating Faith in the Age of Technology

In a rapidly evolving world shaped by technological advancements, Christian leaders are finding themselves at the forefront of discussions about the ethical and practical implications of artificial intelligence (AI). Recent developments show that both ecclesiastical institutions and religious communities are taking significant steps to address AI's challenges and opportunities while remaining true to their theological principles.

## The Church's Ethical Stance on AI

Christianity's engagement with AI has been marked by calls for caution and ethical responsibility. According to a *Time* article, Pope Leo XIV has been proactive in urging religious leaders and technologists to approach AI with care. He emphasized the technology's potential for spreading the Gospel, yet warned of its dangers to individual and societal well-being, particularly concerning its potential influence on children and families (Time, 2025) [^1^].

The dangers associated with AI are not limited to the Catholic Church. The Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission (ERLC) has provided a robust critique of AI's role in religious life. The ERLC's guide emphasizes that while AI can aid in sermon preparation, it should never replace the sacred duty of crafting spiritually inspired messages, which require prayerful contemplation and divine inspiration (Christian Post) [^2^].

In a broader context, the Vatican has released a comprehensive document titled "Antiqua et Nova" that highlights the necessity of maintaining AI's alignment with human dignity and ethical values. The document argues that while technological progress is part of God's plan, AI must be utilized in ways that truly support the common good and uphold moral responsibility (Vatican) [^3^].

## Leveraging AI Positively in Worship

On a more optimistic note, churches are also exploring AI's potential benefits. At an event organized by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Pope Leo XIV called upon Catholic technologists to use AI to further the Church's mission of evangelization. The Pope's message encourages creative applications that spread Christian teachings while respecting individuals' dignity (USCCB) [^4^].

Similarly, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has also updated its handbook to reflect an AI guideline that promotes its use in ways that enhance, rather than replace, spiritual learning and teaching (Newsroom, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) [^5^]. This directive underscores the importance of maintaining human-centered relationships with God, relying on divine inspiration that AI cannot replicate.

## Bridging Faith with AI Innovation

Prominent projects highlight AI’s role in enhancing spiritual experiences. Vatican's collaboration with Microsoft resulted in an AI-generated digital twin of St. Peter's Basilica, allowing virtual visitation and meticulous monitoring for conservation needs. This initiative not only helps preserve a historic site but also democratizes access to one of Christianity's most revered architectural achievements (AP News) [^6^].

Across these initiatives, a common theme emerges: While AI holds vast potential to augment the Church's outreach and internal processes, it must be navigated with a steadfast commitment to ethical considerations, theological directives, and human dignity. As Christian communities continue to explore the intersection of faith and technology, it is critical for the Church to guide this journey with wisdom and caution, ensuring that technological tools serve rather than dictate religious experience.

In conclusion, the ongoing dialogue about AI among Christian leaders and institutions reflects a balanced approach—embracing innovation while remaining vigilant against ethical compromises. This conversation is not merely about adapting to new tools, but about reaffirming the Church's mission and values in a modern context.
