# Embracing AI in the Christian Faith: Perspectives and Insights from Global Christian Leaders

As artificial intelligence (AI) technology rapidly advances, global Christian leaders are stepping forward with guidance and reflections on how this technology can impact the Christian faith and its practices. Various religious authorities have called for a careful and ethical integration of AI within church activities, emphasizing its potential to enhance evangelization and community building while cautioning against replacing the human touch central to faith experiences.

## Christian Leaders on AI: Bridging Faith and Technology

In a world increasingly dominated by technology, Christian leaders are advocating for a balanced approach to AI's integration. This involves using AI as a tool to augment, rather than replace, traditional Christian practices and teachings. One of the central themes emerging from recent discussions is the unique capability of AI to assist with the everyday functions of church communities, such as spreading Biblical messages, enhancing educational initiatives, and sustaining religious engagement, particularly as physical church attendance faces challenges ([According to USCCB](https://www.usccb.org/news/2025/pope-leo-xiv-urges-catholic-technologists-spread-gospel-ai)).

Pope Leo XIV's stance captures the essence of this perspective. In his address to the Builders AI Forum in Rome, he urged Christian technologists to harness the power of AI to further the church’s mission. This entails developing AI applications that support evangelization and uphold human dignity by complementing human efforts in fields like education and healthcare, without overreliance ([USCCB](https://www.usccb.org/news/2025/pope-leo-xiv-urges-catholic-technologists-spread-gospel-ai)).

## AI Enhancing Spiritual Engagement

In the United States, the Vatican's partnership with Microsoft to create a "digital twin" of St. Peter's Basilica showcases how AI can enrich spiritual experiences. This technology allows virtual visitors to explore the Basilica, thereby democratizing access to one of Christianity’s most important landmarks. The initiative not only brings spiritual sites closer to global audiences but also enhances preservation efforts by identifying structural issues requiring attention ([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/vatican-microsoft-basilica-artificial-intelligence-c37d066dc7455ffacece2457c4f8e1a1)).

Meanwhile, various churches, especially those facing dwindling physical attendance, have embraced AI to maintain connections with their congregations. Chatbots offering interactive Biblical discussions ('Text With Jesus' app) and tailored spiritual advice highlight how technology can keep believers engaged in an era where digital and physical lines often blur ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/11/12/christian-ai-chatbot-jesus-god-satan-churches)).

## The Ethical Considerations and Critiques

Despite the optimism about AI’s potential benefits, Christian leaders are also vocal about its ethical implications. The Vatican recently released a document, "Antiqua et Nova," which underscores the moral need to ensure AI complements human intelligence rather than replacing it. It warns against the danger of AI being perceived as possessing human-like capabilities, cautioning against 'creating a substitute for God' through AI-generated deities or spiritual guides ([America Magazine](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2025/01/28/vatican-artificial-intelligence-document-249797)).

The Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission (ERLC) of the Southern Baptist Convention has also warned against using AI to create sermons, stressing that such practices could dilute the essential spiritual processes involved in sermon preparation ([Christian Post](https://www.christianpost.com/news/erlc-warns-against-use-of-ai-to-write-sermons.html)).

## A Call for Ethical Frameworks

As churches continue to incorporate AI within their practices, there is a consistent call for ethical frameworks to guide AI development and use. This includes accountability measures to prevent misuse and to ensure AI serves as a tool for human and communal upliftment. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has updated its General Handbook to provide enduring guidance on AI, emphasizing its role in supporting humane and divine interactions while providing principles for its ethical use ([Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Newsroom](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/general-handbook-enduring-guidance-artificial-intelligence)).

The swift embrace of AI by religious institutions illustrates a broader recognition of technology's potential to complement and enhance religious faith. However, this adoption is accompanied by a vigilant commitment to preserving the core spiritual experiences and moral frameworks that underpin the Christian doctrine. As such, the dialogue between technology and theology continues to evolve, fostering strategies that align technological advancements with spiritual growth and ethical integrity.
