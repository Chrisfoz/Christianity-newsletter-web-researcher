# World Christianity News: Key Developments Over the Past Two Weeks

In recent weeks, significant events have transpired in the realm of global Christianity, reflecting the ever-evolving relationship between faith and technology, particularly focusing on the implications of artificial intelligence (AI). Here is an analysis of how Christian leaders across denominations are navigating this challenging frontier.

## Evangelical Concerns Over AI Boom

Christian leaders from various denominations have raised concerns over the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence. As technology continues to shape society, many church leaders, including Evangelicals, Baptists, and Catholics, are urging for caution and ethical considerations in the deployment of AI.

John Litzler of the Baptist General Convention of Texas emphasized the need to prioritize the moral and spiritual health of the nation over mere technological progress. Pope Leo XIV, in one of his addresses, highlighted the dual potential of AI to spread the Gospel and, regrettably, to contribute to antihuman ideologies and harm to children [Time](https://time.com/7341580/christian-ai-backlash/).

## Churches Embrace AI for Evangelization

Despite the concerns, some churches are embracing AI to enhance their outreach. Innovative applications such as "Text with Jesus" and "EpiscoBot" offer new ways for individuals to engage in personal prayer and gain spiritual insights. These tools aim to address modern challenges such as declining church attendance by facilitating engagement in digital spaces [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/11/12/christian-ai-chatbot-jesus-god-satan-churches).

## Vatican Calls for Ethical AI Usage

The Vatican has published a comprehensive document delineating the role of AI in society and emphasizing the inherent moral responsibilities of its use. Titled "Antiqua et Nova," the document warns against creating AI substitutes for divine guidance, urging for its ethical deployment to benefit human dignity and societal well-being. The document stresses that AI must never replace meaningful human interactions or spiritual discernment [American Magazine](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2025/01/28/vatican-artificial-intelligence-document-249797/).

## Pope Leo XIV's Vision for AI in Ministry

Pope Leo XIV has taken strides in encouraging Catholic technologists to use AI to further the Church's mission of evangelization. At a gathering in Rome, Catholic leaders emphasized the importance of leveraging AI to spread the Gospel while maintaining ethical standards. This stance reflects a balanced approach, recognizing the potential for AI to enhance digital evangelism while guarding against its misuse [USCCB](https://www.usccb.org/news/2025/pope-leo-xiv-urges-catholic-technologists-spread-gospel-ai).

## Southern Baptist Ethical Guidelines on AI

The Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission (ERLC) of the Southern Baptist Convention has issued guidelines warning against the over-reliance on AI for sermon writing. The document underscores that while AI can assist in preliminary tasks, the core of sermon preparation must remain a deeply personal and prayerful endeavor, integral to the spiritual development of church leaders [Christian Post](https://www.christianpost.com/news/erlc-warns-against-use-of-ai-to-write-sermons.html).

## Mormon Church Guidance on AI

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has similarly updated its General Handbook to reflect principled guidance on AI use. It reaffirms that AI should only be used in ways that complement spiritual practices, warning against its use as a substitute for divine inspiration or personal relationships with God and others [Church News](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/general-handbook-enduring-guidance-artificial-intelligence).

## Conclusion

As AI technologies continue to advance, Christian leaders worldwide are actively engaging with the ethical, spiritual, and social implications of these developments. Through a cautious yet innovative approach, they aim to ensure that technology serves humanity and the mission of the Church while safeguarding the core tenets of their faith. This dynamic intersection of faith and technology is illustrative of the broader dialogue within the global Christian community regarding the role of AI in shaping the future of religious practice and belief systems.
