# The Intersection of Christianity and Artificial Intelligence: Recent Developments and Insights

In the last couple of weeks, the Christian world has been actively engaging with the growing influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on both its potential as a tool for ministry and the ethical implications it raises. Below is a snapshot of the latest discussions and guidance from various Christian entities, highlighting the diverse approaches and insights into utilizing AI within the faith community.

## Embracing AI for Ministry and Evangelism

Recent reports suggest a rising trend in adopting AI technologies within churches to assist with sermon writing, community engagement, and administrative tasks. Most notably, nearly two-thirds of pastors are now reportedly using AI tools like ChatGPT and Grammarly to prepare sermons and address other church needs [(Christian Post)](https://www.christianpost.com/news/majority-of-pastors-using-ai-to-prepare-sermons-study.html). These tools are indicated as beneficial in streamlining processes and sparking creativity, albeit with an emphasis on maintaining a balance between leveraging technology and preserving the unique spiritual insights of human ministry.

Furthermore, some churches are integrating AI in more interactive ways through apps like "Text With Jesus," which provide engaging experiences for believers to query and explore spiritual content in novel ways [(Axios)](https://www.axios.com/2025/11/12/christian-ai-chatbot-jesus-god-satan-churches).

## Ethical and Theological Implications

The rise of AI has spurred critical conversations about its ethical use in religious settings. The Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission recently advised against replacing human sermon preparation with AI, emphasizing the necessity of personal engagement with scripture [(Christian Post)](https://www.christianpost.com/news/erlc-warns-against-use-of-ai-to-write-sermons.html). This aligns with broader Christian perspectives emphasizing AI as a supplementary tool rather than a replacement for divine inspiration or human insight.

A newly released Vatican document similarly urges caution, underscoring the moral responsibility that accompanies AI's use. The Vatican's statement particularly warns against creating AI applications that might "substitute for God," reflecting on the potential idolatry of deifying technology [(America Magazine)](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2025/01/28/vatican-artificial-intelligence-document-249797).

## Leadership and Guidance from the Latter-day Saints

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has updated its "General Handbook" to guide the use of AI. The church emphasizes that AI should be employed in ways that support—not replace—spiritual growth and discernment. This includes boundaries for using AI in church communications and ensuring sensitive information remains secure [(Church Newsroom)](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/general-handbook-enduring-guidance-artificial-intelligence).

## AI and the Future of Faith Communities

Christian technologists and engineers are at the forefront of shaping AI to reflect ethical and faith-based values. Engineers like Brydon Eastman highlight the role of Christian professionals in guiding AI development in alignment with moral teachings, ensuring technology is used for uplifting and equitable purposes [(Christianity Today)](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/07/meet-christian-engineers-helping-shape-ai/).

Overall, the intersection of AI and Christianity presents both opportunities for expanding ministry capabilities and challenges in ethical implementation. As these discussions and advancements continue, Christian leaders and technologists advocate for integrating AI in ways that uphold the core values of faith and promote the dignity of human life.
