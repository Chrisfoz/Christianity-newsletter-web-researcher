Chow] \n\nCorrespondent\n\nAs technologists race to accelerate AI’s progress with minimal guardrails, they are being met with increasing resistance from a powerful global contingent: Christian leaders and their congregations.\n\nChristians are not a monolith by any means. But this year, Christian leaders across sects—including Catholics, Evangelicals, and Baptists—sounded the alarm on AI’s potential impact on family, human relationships, labor, and the church itself. While many of these critics are not anti-technology, they have become concerned with the rapid pace of progress in the face of real-world harms. So they have started urging caution in sermons, [open letters], and private conversations with political leaders, in an attempt to influence both policy debates and the general public’s perception.\n\nWhite evangelicals make up roughly a [quarter of American voters]. Their outspokenness on AI could play a role in the [widening rift] between the tech leaders in Trump’s administration and his MAGA base as the midterms approach next year.\n\n“Christ asked, ‘What does it profit a man to gain the world and lose his soul?,’” says John Litzler, the general counsel and director of public policy at the Baptist General Convention of Texas. “It’s not that Christians are anti-business or anti-growth. But the soul of our country and of the individuals in our country is more important.”\n\n## Pope Leo and Concerns About Child Harms\n\nThe wariness of some Christians towards AI starts at the very top of the Catholic Church. In May, Pope Leo XIV chose his name as a [reference] to a previous technological revolution that upended society. In the months since, he has used his platform to talk about AI’s potential to help spread the Gospel, but also to manipulate children and serve “antihuman ideologies.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n**Read More:** [_Pope Leo’s Name Carries a Warning About the Rise of AI_] \n\nThe following month, a group of influential bishops wrote [a letter] to the U.S. Congress with policy recommendations on AI. Many other Christian leaders have likewise followed his lead. “Leo XIV made it quite clear that he thinks this is something that the church should be speaking to: not just in terms of defining what it is, but also how it should be used,” says Michael Toscano, a Catholic and the director of the Family First Technology Initiative for the Institute for Family Studies.\n\nIn particular, Christian leaders are voicing fears about AI’s impact on families and children. In November, Pastor Michael Grayston at LifeFamily Austin led a discussion at his church about AI risks, touching on the rising usage of AI companions among teens. “If I'm in a crisis and need a person to talk to, it’s my friend AI, which is a lot easier, and means I don’t have to share with my friends,” he told TIME in Bee Cave, Tex., the next day. “So I'm going to keep doing that, and I'm going to become more and more isolated. That's the trajectory that I'm super fearful of.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany Christians also dislike the way that Silicon Valley leaders have used religious language or iconography to support their mission of building God-like machines. The venture capitalist Peter Thiel, for example, has [invoked] the antichrist in lectures, theorizing that such a figure might wield anti-AI sentiment to amass political power. In November, Marc Andreessen [posted a meme] on X that appeared to mock Pope Leo over a post about AI.\n\nAndrea Sparks, the co-founder of Not on Our Watch Texas, an initiative raising awareness of online child exploitation, says that when she heard Thiel’s comments about regulation being part of the antichrist’s mission, “It blew my mind.” She adds: “The Commandments tell us to love God and love one another, and I believe AI companions move us away from that.”\n\n## Anti-Accelerationism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are also Christian leaders who acknowledge the potential benefits of AI tools. Father Michael Baggot, a professor at the Pontifical Athenaeum Regina Apostolorum in Rome, remembers how difficult it was to dive into Catholicism at the beginning of his religious journey. He now serves as an advisor to Magisterium AI, a chatbot app designed to answer questions about Catholicism and faith. “It is accessible 24/7 in a way that no priest or professor is available, and provides very clear and concise summaries of topics that can be a bit confusing or difficult to approach,” he says.\n\nBut while Baggot sees clear use cases—such as [translating the Bible] into different languages—he has also grown disenchanted with the tech industry’s priority to accelerate AI tools regardless of the risks, particularly to children. He has taught courses about the dangers of AI companions and offered counsel to [Megan Garcia], whose son, Sewell Setzer, died by suicide in 2024 after becoming romantically obsessed with a chatbot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is also troubled by the AI industry’s intention to displace workers. (Elon Musk, for example, has [predicted] that work will be rendered “optional” by AI.) “The church emphasizes that labor is important not only for what it produces, but because of the process of interior growth and community ties that it fosters,” he says. “I don't think it's enough to simply throw money at \\[displaced workers\\] and to tell them to get out of the way so that the rest of society can move forward.”\n\nNina Lutz, a PhD student at the University of Washington, recently worked on a project in which she interviewed 40 faith leaders about their relationship with technology. She heard many concerns, especially about AI accelerationism. “This notion that we are going to invest everything into AI and push it through as fast as possible, a lot of religious stakeholders found that really concerning,” she says. “They felt as though religious and other communities were being left behind.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Getting involved in policy\n\nThese concerns have led some Christian leaders to become active in public policy, urging politicians to enact AI guardrails. This puts them in opposition to Donald Trump and his tech allies, who urge a light-touch approach. In May, Evangelical leaders [sent] an open letter to Trump warning of the dangers of out-of-control artificial intelligence and of automating human labor. In November, a coalition of 43 faith leaders [sent] a letter to Congress, urging lawmakers not to preempt state AI laws in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). A [separate coalition] that included the National Association of Evangelicals urged the House to rein in AI chatbots.\n\nChris MacKenzie, vice president of communications at the Americans for Responsible Innovation, says that the mission of his AI safety-focused nonprofit has been boosted by the outspokenness of faith leaders. “Some members of Congress, especially on the right, are really guided by their faith,” he says. “So faith leaders have a real impact in speaking to those people.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Toscano, at the Institute for Family Studies, has embarked on a similar mission. He co-runs the Faith Family Technology network, a weekly convening of public policy authors, technologists, academics, and religious leaders of many faiths, in an attempt to shape AI’s present and future. “Our basic view that an attempt to develop artificial intelligence without reference to the wisdom of religious communities is doomed to create something that will not be good for people,” he says.\n\nThe network has exerted its influence in major AI policy battles this year. Members wrote and circulated letters from faith leaders criticizing [preemption efforts]; backchanneled with the team behind the podcast Steve Bannon’s War Room, a major voice against the AI [moratorium] from the GOP’s right flank; and put together a policy working group that shaped the final text of [Josh Hawley’s AI companions bill].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrad Littlejohn, the network's co-leader, says that an increasing number of conservative Christians are now realizing that they are not in alignment with the Trump administration’s accelerationist approach to AI. And because they make up such a large demographic in the U.S., their influence could undermine politicians’ efforts to push forward AI without any guardrails in the coming years. “Before, they really cared that Trump won the battle against censorship. But it wasn't obvious to people that the battle over censorship wasn't the big battle,” he says. “The really big battle was coming over AI.”\n\n## Must-Reads from TIME\n\n- [Pope Leo Calls His Appointment a Cross and a Blessing in First Mass as Pontiff] \n\n- [The Cultural Impact of Notre Dame Football Goes Far Beyond the Playing Field] \n\n- [What Exactly Is Trump’s Religious Liberty Commission—and Why Have Some Experts Raised Concerns?] \n\n- [Pope Leo’s Name Carries a Warning About the Rise of AI] \n\n- [Trump’s Cuts to The Department of Education Are Part of a Long Fight by Conservative Christians] \n\n- [With Letter to Trump, Evangelical Leaders Join the AI Debate] \n\n\n- [Pope Leo Calls His Appointment a Cross and a Blessing in First Mass as Pontiff] \n\n- [The Cultural Impact of Notre Dame Football Goes Far Beyond the Playing Field] \n\n- [What Exactly Is Trump’s Religious Liberty Commission—and Why Have Some Experts Raised Concerns?] \n\n\nRead More"

ChatGPT, the most famous of large language models (LLMs)—programs that can function as chatbots, create content, and perform administrative tasks based on conversational instructions from users—launched in late 2022. Since then, LLMs have rapidly progressed in their capabilities and are increasingly integrated into our digital lives.\nBut should they be[integrated into] our*spiritual*lives? Should[pastors use] LLMs to[write sermons] or[reformat sermon content] into small-group study guides? Should church websites have chatbots on hand to answer visitors’ questions around the clock? Is there a role for AI in[discipleship and catechesis]?\nMy own answer (others at CT may hold different views) to all those questions is*no.*While I do see some practical uses for AI—like transcribing the dialogue below, with a backstop of full human review—I’m deeply wary of proposals to bring LLMs and similar AI tools into the life of the church. I believe that chatbots have no place in spiritual formation or pastoral care and that even many simpler applications, like telling a potential visitor when the Sunday service starts, are already amply handled by regular old websites.\n## Sign up for The Daily Briefing\nGet the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily.\nEmail\\*Sign Up\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google[Privacy Policy] and[Terms of Service] apply.\nThanks for signing up.\nExplore[more newsletters] —don&#8217;t forget to start your[free 60-day trial of CT] to get full access to all articles in every newsletter.\nSorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\nThose instincts made me curious about Gloo, a dominant player in the “Christian AI” space. The Colorado-based company brands itself as “the leading technology platform dedicated to connecting the faith ecosystem,”[and last summer] it announced $110 million in new venture capital funding.\n[Gloo promises] “AI you can trust for life’s biggest questions,” a chatbot that “guides you to real answers and next steps for a life that matters.” An animation on its site suggests that users ask the chatbot “anything” about the Bible, politics, religion, relationships, and more.\nGloo offers “verified” answers from “reliable sources” that are “biblically sound” and “grounded in faith-based principles” so it can “guide you and those you care about with confidence.” But equally—[on the same page, in the same list] —the company offers personalization so individual users can get answers that reflect what they already believe.\n“Customize your experience with filters that align with your values, ensuring every result reflects what matters most to you,” the site says next to an illustration apparently suggesting users can reject an information source for their personal AI interface.\nThis language left me wondering what it means to make[what Gloo calls] “values-aligned” AI. The company first connected me to its chief AI officer, Steele Billings. Our conversation centered on the technology, and Billings explained that Gloo uses Microsoft’s[Responsible AI], then layers its own standards and training data from Christian sources on top.\nThat starts with Harvard’s[Global Flourishing Study], which[defines human flourishing] in[six dimensions]: “happiness and life satisfaction, physical and mental health, meaning and purpose, character and virtue,” “close social relationships,” and “financial and material stability.” To that list, with help from evangelical polling firm the Barna Group, Billings told me, Gloo added a seventh dimension of faith and spirituality.\n[![Three ovals containing hands holding glowing points of light on an orange background.]] \nrelated### [Measuring the Good Life] \nBrendan Case, Katelyn N. G. Long, Tyler J. VanderWeele, and Byron R. Johnson\nOf course, people of faith are famously prone to disagreement about the truth—thus the personalization. Gloo tools can be customized by individual, congregational and denominational users, Billings said: “One of the things that our technology does is it will go out when a church signs up” and “pull the statement of faith off the church website” so it can “answer questions that are aligned with that statement of faith.”\nThat customization even extends outside the church, Billings confirmed when I asked about other religions, like Judaism or Islam. “While today you would see mostly Protestant organizations on our platform,” he told me, “we do not prohibit in any way a Muslim organization from coming in and using our technology.”\nLater this spring, I also spoke with Brad Hill, Gloo’s chief solutions officer. That conversation, which turned from the technical details to Gloo’s philosophy of AI development and function, is below. It has been edited and condensed.\nEditor’s note: Christianity Today has partnered with Gloo on advertising projects in the past, including the development of branded content about[AI and the church]. These projects have never involved CT’s editorial team and had no influence on this article.\nI’d like to focus here on some higher-level questions about the purpose, goals, and visions that Gloo has for the Kingdom-Aligned Large Language Model (KALLM) and for your work with churches in particular. Let’s start with something your colleague, Steele Billings, said when we spoke about the technical side of this work: “Technology is neutral,” and it’s about what we choose to do with it, what kind of worldview we bring to that task, whether it’s a biblical worldview. Is that Gloo’s mindset? If yes, what does that look like? How do you think about it?\nThat’s a great starting point. Yes, that is what we would contend: The technology is neutral.\nPut another way, I’ve heard it described as amoral. It’s neither good nor bad. It can certainly be applied for things that are quite bad, but also it can be applied for things that are incredibly good and incredibly redemptive.\nOur contention is that in every other station of culture, wherever we look in the world, technology is being used. And our strong belief is that the church—and those in ministry and, as we would say, the faith and flourishing ecosystem—needs to be equipped with the very same tools for good. It’s important. It&#8217;s not a “nice to have” anymore.\nOne reason is that technology is more than just tools, bits and bytes. It’s shaping culture. Look at what happened with social media over the last decade plus. Look at the internet and how it’s affected every station of life. AI is now a very similar phenomenon that’s upon us. So while the technology itself might be classified as neutral, we would contend strongly that people who are in the business of flourishing and people who are trying to advance good need to be equipped with the very best tech so that they can apply it to that end.\n[![]] \nrecommended### [AI Will Shape Your Soul] \n[Kate Lucky] \nIf I can probe that a little bit, I think there are many uses of AI that are pretty uncontroversial: people who use it as a search engine, for example, or administrative functions like scheduling meetings. Where it tends to be controversial, as you no doubt know, is around creating material—for instance, writing sermons or study guides based on sermons. And so that affirmation that the technology is neutral, is that truly across-the-board for Gloo? Or are there areas that you would say are off-limits?\nIt’s an interesting question, and I think honestly there are different answers to that question depending on whether you have AI tools that are built with a values alignment or not.\nWe don’t say technology is neutral if we’re dealing with tools that just have a general-market use, which is mostly what the public is familiar with right now. Even your example that was somewhat innocuous—of using ChatGPT as a search engine—I would contend that’s*not*neutral, because most folks may not fully understand where ChatGPT is getting its results, and those results are likely not aligned to the values of someone who follows Christianity or adheres to biblical truth. If you ask questions on matters of ethics and deeply felt needs, you may get answers that are antithetical to Scripture.\nHowever, when you have tools that are built on more of a biblical foundation and aligned to human flourishing values, I would say my answer broadens regarding what’s within bounds. Because then you feel a lot more confident turning to these tools to answer questions around some of those weightier issues. That’s exactly what we see at Gloo.\nRight now, there’s a gap in the market for generative AI tools that are trained on the values we hold. So for instance, I could ask ChatGPT to help me plan dinner. I think ChatGPT is a wonderful tool for that or for scheduling, as you said. But when we’re asking these weightier questions around faith, ethics, and morality, we want tools built on a model that’s been trained on proper values.\nAnd that’s what Gloo is building now. We’re ultimately not looking to fully*replace*tools like ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini but to*complement*them and leverage the good that’s in all of them so that we have an incredible tool that can tell me what to make for dinner*and*can help me as a parent or in a relationship or when I’m exploring faith.\nIt’s funny you mention a market gap, because that’s my next question. You think about the classic inventor—say, Eli Whitney and the cotton gin. We can see the market gap there: We don’t want to process this cotton by hand anymore. Here, yes, there’s a market gap in the sense you’re describing: These other LLMs have different values, and maybe their makers present these tools as ethically neutral when really they’re not. So for Gloo, the market gap is for an LLM with biblically informed values.\nBut I want to ask about a market gap in a different sense, which is: What is the lack in the church that this tool is filling? What is it that 2,000 years of Christianity didn’t have that this AI is going to provide?\nYou mean what is AI itself filling as a gap?\n**Yeah, what is the gap in the church?**\nWell, the premise of your question is that we have this timeless gospel message that is complete and sufficient, and we start there. However, what’s also true is that in the world around us, culture constantly moves.\nEven in biblical times, we saw examples of technology. Jesus used the Roman roads. Later on, we had the printing press. When the printing press was first invented, there were plenty of religious leaders decrying that as unnecessary or even evil. So all throughout history, we have examples where initially people of faith are skeptical of a new technology. What happens every time, though, is that culture responds to that new technology and there are new standards or practices that emerge. As Christians, we’re then faced with the question of how we apply this timeless gospel to what’s changed.\nThink of the average congregation: maybe 150 people, a pastor, maybe a youth pastor or secretary. They worship together every Sunday. When you look at that church, what part of that do you see and say, “We need to put AI in there?” Is it the service? Is it the pastoral care? It doesn’t sound like it’s just the scheduling.\nYeah, well, I mean, it doesn’t matter what size church you are. You could be giant, or you could be a hundred people. Like you said, the people in your church are experiencing the most dramatic shift we’ve ever seen in humanity. I mean, AI is affecting them as parents. It’s affecting them in relationships and as workers in jobs. So when our surveys have come back, what we hear is people in churches are interested in their pastors and their leaders helping them navigate this new post-AI world. That’s one thing.\nAnd yes, there are tools that can help with the operational side of church too. It can help us with content repurposing. It can help us with language translation and other administrative tasks.\nBut we also think, as we get deeper into this, that there’s a profound and lasting impact on every life and every church from AI, and the church has an opportunity now to think about how we understand what’s going on and how we equip our people to navigate whatever questions or whatever challenges are coming at them outside the church. The church can be a place where we can come to learn how to navigate a post-AI world.\nI think that’s vital, and pastors should absolutely help us navigate the post-AI world. But what I would want to distinguish here is that there seems to me to be a big difference between one, that guidance, and two, using an AI chatbot to ask personal spiritual questions.\nFor instance, when I emailed with your colleague Chase Cappo, Gloo’s AI enterprise director, he mentioned—and I believe he was talking about KALLM, but correct me if I’m wrong—that there’d already been more than 10 million conversations with Gloo’s Christian AI app. He said that people were “getting more personal than with most pastors.” And I don’t know about you, but I’m a parent, and if I found out my kid was taking personal spiritual questions to a chatbot instead of me or our pastor or another trusted adult human, I would be highly alarmed.\nI think there’s a very big difference between pastors helping Christians navigate a post-AI world and pastors providing Christians with a tool that has no soul so they can talk to it about the state of their spirits, the state of their relationships with God.\nWell, first of all, as a parent, cannot agree more with your sentiment.\nAnd I would also just share we have a core principle at Gloo, and the way we phrase it is that relationships catalyze growth. Our belief is that God has wired each and every one of us to really grow best in the context of relationship, not in the context of interacting with an app or with content or what have you.\nSo when you hear us talk, for example, about values-aligned AI, one of the principles that really drives our work is thinking about how these tools*support*a relationship rather than*replacing*a relationship. And there is a danger of that with the tools we see today. You illustrated one example, where someone might turn to a chat tool in lieu of a person.\nAs we navigate this at Gloo, one of the principles we want to literally design into any tool that supports human flourishing is not just to provide a helpful, productive answer to someone’s question but to point them toward discussing it further, getting into a conversation, making a connection with someone. You’re not going to see most general-market tools behave that way for various reasons. We believe that every tool should support relationship.\n[![Two men carrying a computer window on their shoulders with a golden calf on it.]] \nrelated### [The Silicon Calf] \nA.G. Elrod\n**Practically speaking, would that look like? For instance, certain keywords would prompt the tool to say, “Hey, go talk to your pastor about this”?**\nYeah. Well, in the example that Chase gave you, we have a set of tools called assistants that are placed in various spots. They might be on church websites, or they might be in apps—little chatbots and the like. They’re built with a feature called escalation. We’re learning patterns of when a conversation is appropriate to conduct via chatbot. Like, “What time are the services on Sunday?” “Do you have children’s programming?” Those are fairly administrative, factual questions.\nBut when the conversations get a little bit more sensitive or lose appropriateness for the chatbot, the tool is going to say, “That’s a great question. Let me see if I can connect you to someone at the church who can explain more.” And that then escalates the conversation away from AI to humans. That’s an example of how we support a relationship. We’re not looking keep the conversation in a chatbot forever. We want to eventually make a human connection.\nYou mentioned regular ChatGPT could be damaging to our social, spiritual, or relational health because it*does*have values—and perhaps values we don’t even notice. But if there’s a new technology being used to some negative or at best neutral end, to my mind it doesn’t clearly follow that Christians should just put out the modified “Christian” version of it. There are, I think, some things where we just have to say, “No, that’s not something we’re going to try to redeem.”\nDo you see a line like that coming up in the future of AI as it progresses? Or is this particular technology a case where we*can*do a modified Christian version? I’m not going to hold you to this 50 years down the line, of course, if AI takes an unanticipated swerve. But so far as we can see, is this something we can continue modifying to our purposes?\nI’m tracking with your question. When we use AI as an umbrella term, it refers to such a vast set of technologies and tools and capabilities that we’re really just beginning to understand. So it’s kind of like asking, “Are there guardrails where books should not be used for certain things? Or where the internet should not be used?” I mean, it is quite broad.\nIn that sense, the answer has to be yes. Of course there will be certain applications and uses that, no matter how much you try to redeem it, will destroy human flourishing. They’re going to be antithetical to it. The list would probably be what you’d expect, nefarious or destructive uses around mental health, adult entertainment, and so on.\nBut I think that it would be hard to just outright discard AI or chatbots or any similar category, because each of them can be applied to save lives and find cures for cancer. They can also be applied to negatively affect mental health. The opportunity, I think, and the challenge for us is to distinguish between uses, like between what I cook for dinner and how I parent through a hard situation.\nWe don’t need a modified Christian version to teach me how to cook, but we do need it for matters of ethics, mental health, faith, and so on. That’s the nuance where we’re applying a values-aligned layer over top of the existing tools, not trying to create a replacement for what’s already out there.\n[![Pixel art of a demon with fire bolts flighting a stained glass cross with sparkles.]] \nrelated### [The Bible’s Challenge to Technofans and Technophobes] \n[Andrew Wilson] \n**Having been a new parent relatively recently, I’m very familiar Googling, “How do I get my kid to do X, Y, or Z?” I’m sure you’re right that this is a common way people are using these tools. Is it*inevitable*, though? When people speak about technology—and not just about AI—often they speak in terms of inevitability: “It’s coming. You can’t stop it. You just have to make the best of it.”**\n**And there is some truth to that. Certainly, at the individual level, I have no control. But I question it at the societal scale. I think you see a reconsideration of this kind of thinking with social media, as we’ve belatedly realized its downsides. We*do*have agency, actually. This stuff*isn’t*inevitable, and adapting and redeeming are not the only options.**\nI’m not a pastor, but if I were, I would not want my congregants to inevitably turn to computers for answers to weighty questions about parenting as a Christian. So are we resigned to a future in which people*will*take their problems to computers and all we can do is make sure they take them to computers with our values?\nIt’s so easy to sympathize with a pastor, a parent—anyone who wonders, “Hey, is this a foregone conclusion? Can we not stop the train?”\nAny child growing up today is never going to live in a world that doesn’t have AI. And I think right now, today, in first half of 2025, generally when you’re interacting with these conversational applications or these generative AI tools, you know what you’re doing—that is, I purposefully opened the ChatGPT app on my phone. I know that I’m using it.\nBut I think what we’re going to see as time goes on is that AI will become more and more embedded in more and more things that we do and use every day. It’s going to be in our cars. It’s going to be on our phones. It will be how we consume entertainment, education, what have you.\nMy belief—and, I think, the way Gloo would look at this—is that we see both an opportunity and a responsibility, not just for pastors but for all people of faith. It’s a renewed call for discernment, right?\nI think that maybe an effort to stop young people from using AI tools could be workable for some period of time. But what’s probably more likely and admittedly more nuanced is that we need to teach them how to responsibly use those tools for good.\nWith my own children, we have conversations about what they’re learning, what answers they’re getting back from AI, and how those answers square with what they know to be true. Because we’ve talked about biblical truth. We’ve talked about principles outside what they’re encountering in those tools. There’s an opportunity for pastors, parents, and educators to equip and arm people to have a truth detector and to understand that when you get answers back from AI, you don’t have to accept those outright. You should question and be curious.\nHopefully that kind of discernment is something we’ve always had, but the stakes are higher now with these tools. They speak realistically, and they give us answers that sound right, but that information requires more inspection sometimes.\nI share that hope as well—that we will be able to develop that kind of discernment. I do wonder, though, what it communicates if on the one hand we’re saying, “Hold these tools at an arm’s length. Test what you’re hearing against the truth,” but then on the other hand, when I come to my church’s website, it has an AI chatbot. That’s my church, so why would I doubt it? Isn’t that a confusing message? “Be circumspect about AI and chatbots,” but also “Here’s our chatbot. It’s good.”\nThat’s a great point. And I think you’re really getting to matters, ultimately, of trust. We should be able to trust our religious institutions or houses of faith, and they historically have been a place where trust is held in high esteem. It can also be quickly broken.\nAI tools give churches now a tremendous ability. A small church using AI can create content and repurpose content in forms and languages that would’ve been out of reach only three or five years ago. A small church of 50 people could now have a Spanish-speaking ministry if they chose. That’s a wonderful thing.\nBut to your point, if that church is choosing to use tools that are exposed to the congregation, I would agree there’s a responsibility for the church to know that tool*is*in fact trustworthy and*does*adhere to the values that the church espouses. That does create a higher burden—a higher bar, if you will—for church leaders before they put a tool out there. They need to ensure that’s an invitation to test, to explore, to be curious, to try to break the tool and make sure it’s going to answer the way the pastor would answer. Otherwise, maybe it’s not ready to go out.\n* * [More fromBonnie Kristian] \n* giftGift This Article\n* ## Share\nSharearrow\\_down\n* [facebook\\_grayscaleFacebook] \n* [x\\_grayscaleX] \n* [whatsapp\\_grayscaleWhatsApp] \n* [telegram\\_grayscaleTelegram] \n* [emailEmail] \n* linkCopy Link\n* giftGift Article\n## Related\n[![]] \n### [Blessed Are the Rich, for They Can Afford to Limit Their Kids’ Screen Time] \n[Bonnie Kristian] \n[![]] \n### [Do Not Conform to the Work Habits of AI] \n[Bonnie Kristian] \n[![Children playing at recess]] \n### [The Christian Schools That Cried Wolf] \n[Bonnie Kristian] \n* [Artificial Intelligence (AI)] \n* [Bonnie Kristian] \n* [Church] \n* [Ethics] \n* [Technology] \n* [Worship] \n## Our Latest\n[View All] \n[![Pastor Elias Rodriguez with three children he flew to Venezuela to reunite with their mother after she was deported without them.]] \n## [Saying ‘Welcome the Stranger’ Is Easy.

Disenchantment was supposed to free humanity from believing in “fairy tales” like Christianity.\n\nBut this worldview has proven unlivable. People are still searching for spiritual meaning. The rise of artificial intelligence has ushered in an era of reenchantment, with AI proselytizers using unscientific, mystical, and even religious language to describe the technology’s transformative potential for humanity. They have likened their role as midwives birthing a nonhuman supersentience or as prophets [summoning gods].\n\nThis reenchantment is not value-neutral. AI is not being developed in an ideological vacuum. Rather, its design is indelibly shaped by quasi-religious beliefs rooted in digital gnosticism—a dualistic worldview that seeks transcendence over the material world by leveraging digital technology.\n\n## Sign up for CT Pastors\n\nEach weekly CT Pastors issue equips you with the best wisdom and practical tools for church ministry.\n\nEmail\\*\nSign Up\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google [Privacy Policy] and [Terms of Service] apply.\n\nThanks for signing up.\n\nExplore [more newsletters] —don’t forget to start your [free 60-day trial of CT] to get full access to all articles in every newsletter.\n\nSorry, something went wrong.

Every inefficiency, from the ordinary frictions of community to the inevitability of death, must be overcome through technology. And the downstream implications—for both the church and religious belief in America—are legion.\n\nMore than 80 years ago, C. S. Lewis issued this warning in [The Abolition of Man]:\n\n> There is something which unites magic and applied science \\[technology\\] while separating them from the “wisdom” of earlier ages. For the wise men of old the cardinal problem of human life was how to conform the soul to objective reality, and the solution was wisdom, self-discipline, and virtue. For the modern, the cardinal problem is how to conform reality to the wishes of man, and the solution is a technique.\n\nAI is the digital gnostic’s messiah. It offers every user the gift of knowledge and power, untethered from wisdom and virtue. So much so that artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been called humanity’s “last invention,” after which it will supposedly be able to do all future inventing for us. If so, our “ [technological Rapture] ” is just around the corner.\n\nDigital gnosticism then, is the “good news” that we will be saved by merging with the machine, allowing AI to optimize us for eternal life (as in Bryan Johnson’s “ [Don’t Die] ” movement) or using AI to project our consciousness across the universe.\n\nI wish I could say this was science fiction, but these are genuine beliefs flooding a culture now lacking the gravitational pull of Christianity at its center.\n\nThis is why the church is needed more than ever. As I wrote in [The Reason for Church], “the church is not merely the sum of individuals who believe the same thing and live in the same geographic area. Every church is a living, breathing _embodiment_ of the gospel story” (emphasis added).\n\nAs such, weekly worship is a “strange, thin place between a fallen world and the God who helps us make sense of it all.” It’s no wonder that widespread dechurching has only made people more desperate for meaning and less discerning in where to search for it.\n\n## related\n\n### [How Am I? Bad!] \n\nNatalie Mead\n\n### [I’m a Gen Z Woman. I’m Staying in Church.] \n\nJenna Mindel\n\nRecently, a Google employee at our church who works with AI asked the students in our youth ministry, “Where do you go when you have questions you don’t think your parents will be able to answer?” About a quarter of them said ChatGPT. We already trust online influencers more than institutions, and 42 percent of adults use AI for emotional support. Digital divination—trusting a chatbot to tell us the truth about reality—doesn’t require a leap of faith.\n\nBut what if our divining isn’t a digital facsimile? What if there are ghosts in the machine? Scripture reminds us that the spiritual world is just as real as the material one. God exists, miracles happen, and angels and demons are at work. Because we wrestle “against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places” (Eph. 6:15), we can’t categorically dismiss reports that, as [Rod Dreher] put it, “evil discarnate intelligences use \\[AI\\] to communicate with people.” If the cardboard and plastic of a Ouija board can be a gateway to dark spiritual forces, why not digital ones and zeros?\n\nWhether AI is merely reflecting our superstitious hopes and fears back at us or there is a ghost in the machine, Deuteronomy 18 wouldn’t list using mediums, divination, and necromancy as “abominations to the Lord” if there were no spiritual risks.\n\nDigital gnosticism will ultimately prove just as futile as secular materialism. We are creatures made of dirt and breath. We will never transcend our need for the fullness of existence. And in Christ, we have it.\n\nBecause American individualism has always been more than a little gnostic, we often see our union with Christ as  a merely spiritual reality. We treat church as optional, but it never would have occurred to Paul that one could be spiritually in Christ without fully and physically abiding in Christ’s body. It is only in the church, Paul says, that “the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places” (Eph. 3:10).\n\nIf we want to be reenchanted by the gospel and inoculated to digital gnosticism, we will need a rechurching even greater than our dechurching. We can start by devoting ourselves to a local church and participating in the ordinary means of grace—Word, sacrament, and prayer. In our gathered worship and witness, we rehearse the drama of redemption. In serving our neighbors and loving our enemies, we resist artificial intelligence with otherworldly love.\n\nAI may offer “a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ” (Col. 2:17, ESV). God loves us too much to let us go on existing without him. That’s why I believe reenchantment will include a greater openness to the gospel. It is therefore the church’s task—nay, privilege—to welcome digital gnostics into a true and better enchantment.\n\nBrad Edwards is the lead pastor at The Table Church in Lafayette, Colorado.

Please try again.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\nFirst, to make sure our readers have a good sense of what Creed does and how you do it, tell me about your tech stack and training. What large language model are you using as the base for the app, and what are the specific resources that you use to train it?\nThink of the product as a Tamagotchi meets Duolingo for a Christian.\nThink of it as a best friend and youth pastor in your pocket that you can talk to about any questions, be it your personal life, be it faith questions, be it your Bible studies. It’ll give you answers rooted in Scripture, but it’ll also build on that relationship over time. It remembers things you tell it. The more you talk to it, the more personalized it gets. It develops personalized faith paths for you, and it’ll help you answer questions and find community around you so you can discover Christian events. If you’re not affiliated with a church, it’ll recommend churches for you to go to. So it’s not just talking to a screen.\nOn the back end, we’re not building our own models. We’re using off-the-shelf models from OpenAI, Google, etc. But we noticed that everyone’s using ChatGPT, and people are asking it super personal questions like “Should I get a divorce? Was I the wrong one in this situation?”\nChatGPT will give you an answer, but whose values determine that answer? Who is determining what those values are? That’s a little bit of a black box, but the values are determined by a few companies in Silicon Valley.\nSo how do you set guardrails around that? How do you make sure the answers you get back from the AI are something your pastor or your church leader or your parents would agree with?\nWe take off-the-shelf models and fine-tune them on Scriptures—30 different versions of the Bible. And then on top, a few nonbiblical texts as well, like the texts of C. S. Lewis or a few other, broader Christian authors.\nThen we also use denomination-specific teachings. Different denominations have pastors and priests whose teachings are widely accepted, so we use a few of those. Our offshore teams annotate those texts and label them to ensure some level of denomination-specific accuracy. For the same question, what you might expect as a Southern Baptist is going to be different from what you expect as a Catholic.\nThen the third layer is church-specific nuances. We work with churches in our partner network directly so they can go set their values on “topic X” on top of that denomination-specific nuance. Right now we only have 12 or so churches in our network, and we’re building that out.\nAnd then we set very, very strict guardrails. One of the big issues with AI is hallucination. How do you ensure it’s giving you actual answers? How do you ensure it’s not just making things up? So every answer passes through three filters of checks.\nAnd any kind of sensitive topic—say, transgender rights or gay marriage—we are not going to give you like, “Oh, you should do this” or “You should not do this.” We’ll cite Scripture, and then we’ll tell you to go talk to your pastor or go talk to your parents. A very middle-ground approach where we as a company are not being prescriptive. We want to be very sort of value-neutral, and we want you to go talk to actual trusted authorities.\nIf there’s any mention of self-harm or harm to others, we have a human who will intervene and will be like, “Oh, do you want me to call up your parents?” or “Do you want me to call up this hotline for mental health issues?” We want that human intervention layer in case there’s something that’s super alarming.\nYou’ve mentioned parents, and that plus your description of Creed as an AI youth pastor makes me think your target audience is teenagers. Is that accurate? Can you give me some sense of your typical or ideal user demographics?\nYeah, initially we went to market with a focus on Gen Z. It’s a bit surprising though: About 60 percent of our users are 15- to 30-year-olds. Then I’d say the fastest growing demographic is 50- to 70-year-old women. That’s another 30 percent, and then 10 percent is 30- to 50-year-olds, a mix of males and females.\nWe found unexpected success with demos other than Gen Z, so now we’re trying to make it more age- and gender-neutral in terms of the design and the tone of the AI’s answers. If you use the app today, the way it talks is very Gen Z. But we’re implementing a new voice where it’ll essentially reflect back your own personality and your own voice. It’ll adapt to you. If you use emojis, it’s going to use emojis. If you use full sentences with capitalization, it’ll like that.\n[![Satan, Jezebel, and the Nephilim from AI Bible]] \nrelated### [The AI Bible: ‘We Call It Edutainment’] \n[Interview by Bonnie Kristian] \nYou said in your fact sheet that you had 200,000 users in the first four months. Do you have a number for daily active usership yet?\nDaily active users are around 25,000.\nOkay. And then turning toward the business side, you mentioned in your fact sheet that you got funding from[Andreessen Horowitz Speedrun]. Is your cohort with them ongoing? And I’m also curious about how much funding you were awarded.\nWe started Speedrun in July of this year. When you start, you get $500,000 from them. We finished Speedrun in October, and then after we finished, we raised $4.2 million.\nThat*is*speedy. Accurately named! I would guess that as you’re working with these venture capital folks, you’ve presented a business model for what to do after that initial funding. What is the model going forward?\nIt’s very similar to Duolingo. It’s monthly and annual subscriptions on the consumer end. And then we also offer in-app purchases in addition to the subscription. So think of e-commerce, or very similar to gaming [with] in-app purchases.\nI haven’t used Duolingo in a long time, so I’m not sure: Is there any advertising? Is there sale of user data, or is it just those direct user purchases?\nJust those [direct purchases]. We were going back and forth on whether we should show ads. There are pros and cons. If you show ads, you could potentially make more money, but it really ruins the user experience if you’re chatting about deeply personal issues and suddenly seeing ads. People start to question where their data is going. So we’re going to hold off on ads and purely go with subscription revenue for now.\nTurning from tech and business, I’m interested in your goals for Creed. I think the single most surprising thing in the fact sheet you sent was this sentence: “If you tell your companion that you are feeling sad, it will pray for you.” For me, that raises the question of what your team understands prayer to be. What do you think it is and how you think it works?\nWhen it says the companion will pray for you, it’s more like it’ll pray*with*you. It’s not going to pray for you. It’s more like, “Oh, do you want to pray with me? And how are you feeling?”It’s almost like generating personalized prayers for you that fit your mood and fit the way you like to be prayed with.\nI think the beauty of AI is it’s not pushing something at you. Rather, it’s working with you to build something in collaboration. So this prayer would be very customized to how you&#8217;re feeling and the way you like to pray. You can tell the companion, “This is how my church or my pastor taught me how to pray,” or you can give it a YouTube-style sample prayer.\nThere’s no simple, one-size-fits-all approach to this. How you need to pray can look very different from person to person.\nJust to make sure I understand, you’re saying it would write a prayer that the user would say as opposed to the chatbot praying in its own voice?\nYeah, this would write a prayer, and it’ll basically speak the prayer out loud with the user. So it’s almost like a friend would do it. Like you’d ask a friend, “Hey, can you pray for me?”And then you both would pray that together—\nSpeaking in unison.\nYeah, speaking in unison. Then there’s this other feature we just launched. It’s almost like a prayer wall where you can have other users pray for you. Say you’re in a remote town in Tennessee, and you don’t have a church community or a lot of friends around there, and your mother’s sick, and you want prayer. Other users will join you in that prayer. We launched that two days ago, and we’ve already seen a good adoption of that feature.\nI read[an article] in which a pastor was thinking about this kind of product and specifically about prayer. He made a point that I’ve not seen elsewhere, and I’m interested in your response to it. He said the difference, perhaps, is that one of these prayers is by a soul saved by Christ and the other is written by a program; and, whatever the implications of that, which might God prefer? Does*God*want to receive a prayer written by a machine?\nThat’s a very valid point, and you could go philosophically down that whole rabbit hole, but I think our end goal is helping people out in times of duress.\nAnd sure, a machine-made prayer is definitely not up to the standards of a prayer written by an actual human. But in that situation, if that machine didn’t write a prayer, that prayer would not have happened. So we’d much rather have a prayer, even if it’s of a slightly lower quality, than no prayer at all.\nI think that’s how I think about it, but I think that’s a very valid point in terms of what God prefers. God would probably prefer a human-quality prayer, but it’s hard to scale that service to 3 billion Christians worldwide.\nOf course. I think maybe the alternative would not be that they would turn to a custom human-written prayer, but that they would just pray.\nHalf of our users are folks who very recently turned to God and Christianity. We’ve noticed they use this almost as an introduction to exploring more about the body of Christ and reading the Bible. A lot of them are not familiar with that whole process of praying or what’s the right way to pray—or even getting the words into their minds, in terms of how you compose that prayer. So we don’t want to supplant them praying for themselves; rather we want to build that habit into them.\nThat’s good transition to another question I had. I was struck by the fact sheet’s mention of “Duolingo-style daily quests such as daily prayers/devotionals—the more of these quests that you complete, the more points you accrue, opening up richer devotionals, faith milestones, and tailored guidance.”\nAnd I was baffled by this idea of gamifying the practice of faith and then apparently—correct me if I’m wrong here—withholding the best discipleship materials until people level up or maintain a streak, like in Duolingo. If we’re dealing with new Christians, people who really need help, wouldn’t we give them the richest devotionals off the bat?\nWe’re not withholding devotionals. The way it works is the more points you get, the more sort of rewards you win. These rewards aren’t discipleship frameworks. It’s more like you can customize your character. You can open up new characters. You can buy a hat for your characters. It’s more those sorts of rewards versus actual texts or devotionals. Those are open to everyone, starting day one.\n[![Visitors to St. Paul Church in Fürth, Germany, take part in a pre-recorded service created by ChatGPT in 2023.]] \nrelated### [Should We Bring AI into the Church?] \n[Interview by Bonnie Kristian] \nThe characters—you sent images of users holding the screen with what looks like a sheep. Is the sheep—and maybe later other characters—what you all had in mind when the fact sheet described Creed as “embodied” with a voice, personality, and memories?\nYeah. A lot of chatbots—like ChatGPT, Claude, all of them—are abstract chat forms. But our whole thing was: Can you make this more embodied? Can you give it a personality with a voice, proactively following up with users?\nThat is what we mean by “embodied” versus the more abstract chatbot forms. This idea of embodied companions has been one of the biggest trends in consumer AI over the past couple of years. Most of these embodied AI companies are AI boyfriend or AI girlfriend apps.\nJust to clarify, you don’t mean a physical piece of hardware, like[Friend]. You mean the image on the screen?\nYeah, this is on the screen. This is not a physical thing.\nSo these other embodied AIs are sexualized, weird, romanticized companions. They’re all millions in revenue, but they’re so toxic, and it’s so unhealthy for the future—not just the future of Christianity, but also the future of our younger generations, that people are spending hours per day having weird, sexualized interactions with these AI boyfriends and girlfriends.\nOur initial motivation was to appropriate that same technology but use it to get people closer to God, learn more about the Bible, get them out and discover community instead of having weird interactions.\nYeah, one thing I appreciate in the fact sheet was your policy of cutting people off after an hour of use. That that is a real distinctive you don’t see with a lot of the big names in AI.\nThe more time you spend, the more money they make. It is a very unhealthy cycle.\nRight. That’s a great caution to have. I do wonder about blurring the lines by using “embodied” this way, because having an avatar isn’t usually what we mean when we say “embodied.” It’s a picture instead of text, but it is on a screen still, right? It’s not embodied.\nYeah, I agree with that interpretation. It’s not truly embodied, I guess.\nOkay. As I was preparing for this, I was thinking about when Paul writes to the Galatians, and he’s very worried about them.[He says he’s in the pains of childbirth] until Christ is formed in them, because he’s their pastor and he loves them.\nWhen I think about a young, lonely Christian who maybe has moved to a new city, is struggling to find friends, struggling to get plugged into a local church community—when I think about that person being told that this program is going to be their source for pastoral care, it honestly makes me sad.\nAnd it strikes me as a pretty dark vision for the future of Christianity and the future of the local church. I do appreciate your sense of the importance of pushing people to go find a local congregation, pushing people to get off the screen. I want to affirm that. But on the other hand, it seems to me that merely by*offering*pastoral care with no pastor, you’re kind of giving up on the local church at a level so fundamental that those tweaks may not matter.\nAt the very outset, this is not a replacement for pastoral care. And when you download the app, one of the first things you’ll see is “Find church events near me,” “Find a church near me.”\nWe very much positioned this as a “Christian best friend” app. We are not that pastoral authority. Best case, we might be a youth pastor, but we’re definitely not any kind of authority. We want to push you to actual resources.\nAnd we’re acting very much as lead generator for local churches. As a company, and for me personally, local churches are a backbone of our future, and they need to be revived. Obviously they’re going through a very challenging time now, and we want this app to pull people off TikTok and introduce them to the faith, introduce them to local churches, help provide local pastoral care. I think that’s the funneling role we see our app playing.\nI assume everything’s very data-driven. You have the data to make sure things are working the way as intended. If at a certain point—a year, five years down the line—you are not reliably getting data that people are getting off the internet and becoming meaningfully involved—joining, volunteering—in a local church community, what do you do?\nIf at any point we notice we’re trying to funnel them to actual, real-life engagement, and they’re not doing that, I think that means we failed in our mission as founders and building this company.\nAnd I think at that point, we’d probably want to pivot the business and do something else entirely. That mission is just so central to why we started doing this. And if we fail in that, I think we failed as founders of this company—and at that point it would be better to even shut this down than to get people addicted to some phone game and not go out into the actual world.\nCorrection (January 20, 2026): An earlier version of this article mistitled Adi Agrawal.\n* * [More fromBonnie Kristian] \n* giftGift This Article\n* ## Share\nSharearrow\\_down\n* [facebook\\_grayscaleFacebook] \n* [x\\_grayscaleX] \n* [whatsapp\\_grayscaleWhatsApp] \n* [telegram\\_grayscaleTelegram] \n* [emailEmail] \n* linkCopy Link\n* giftGift Article\n## Related\n[![An apple with a bite as the dot of a wifi signal symbol]] \n### [The Internet’s Sins Are Our Sins.

Its versatility and ease of use make it a powerful asset for streamlining ministry work and sparking creative ideas.\"\nThe data, based on responses from 594 pastors and church staff members, shows that church leaders are now more concerned about \"the weighty ethical and practical considerations involved\" in the use of AI as they continue their rapid embrace of the technology.\nNearly two-thirds of church leaders surveyed who prepare sermons say they use AI tools in their sermon writing process, the researchers note.\n\"This suggests that AI is quickly becoming a key tool for pastors in their weekly message preparation,\" they wrote.\nSome 61% of pastors say they use AI weekly or daily, up from 43% in 2024. In that share, 25% report using AI daily.\n\"Overall, the survey depicts a church that is increasingly open to the ministry possibilities of artificial intelligence, while still grappling with the weighty ethical and practical considerations involved,\" researchers state. \"Most churches seem to believe that AI can be beneficial if used as a tool, but not a replacement for human connection and spiritual discernment.\"\nSome 11% of church leaders report using the AI-powered writing assistant Grammarly for tasks like \"polishing emails, newsletters, blog posts, and other church communications.\" Another 9% said they use Microsoft Co-Pilot, an AI search engine developed by Microsoft, to conduct research, while 8% report using Google Gemini. Another 8% of the church leaders in the study report using Canva Magic Studio, an AI-driven set of design capabilities within the Canva design platform, to design \"social media posts, event flyers, presentation slides, generative AI fill, and other visual design functions.\"\n\"While some may view this as a concerning trend, others likely see it as a way to enhance their research, writing efficiency, and creativity,\" researchers note.  \"As AI sermon writing tools continue to improve, it will be important for church leaders to find the right balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and maintaining their unique voice and spiritual insights.\"\nAbout 30% of the leaders involved in the survey represent churches with fewer than 100 members, while about a quarter (24%) represent churches with between 100 and 249 members. Fourteen percent are leaders of churches with 250 to 499 members; 11% have 500 to 999 members; 14% have 1,000 to 4,999 members and 2% of the leaders are at churches with 5,000 to 9,999 members. Another 2% report more than 10,000 members.\n\"The demographics reveal a broad interest in AI across different leadership roles within the church, with a notable representation from Gen X and Millennials. This diversity suggests a wide acknowledgment of AI's relevance but also indicates the potential for generational divides in technology acceptance and usage,\" the report notes.\nAround half (50%) of the leaders involved in the survey are either lead pastors or executive pastors. The top concerns they had about the use of AI in ministry are now: misinformation and the theological accuracy or alignment of AI-generated content; AI replacing or diminishing personal, spiritual guidance and the quality of human relationships within the church community; privacy and data security; and transparency and accountability.\nStill, church leaders are optimistic about the use of AI in ministry and believe that, with the right training, they can overcome hurdles as they arise. Some 87% of pastors said they are willing to invest in AI education and training for themselves and their staff.\n\"To overcome known hurdles, church leaders will need to prioritize AI education and training for themselves and their staff. This could include attending workshops, partnering with AI experts, and investing in ministry-specific AI resources,\" researchers said. \"Proactively addressing ethical considerations through the development of robust AI policies and frameworks will be critical to building trust and buy-in from congregations. By taking these steps, churches can position themselves to reap the benefits of AI while mitigating potential risks.\"\nA survey released earlier this year by[Pushpay], a leading payments and engagement solutions provider for the faith-based and nonprofit sectors, collected in February from about 8,000 church leaders, suggests that the use of AI has increased by 80% across all ministries in churches, but only for specific tasks.\n\"While adoption (of AI) has increased, leaders remain reluctant to rely on AI for pastoral content. Last year's report revealed that less than one quarter of AI users applied the tool for developing devotionals, sermons, or ideas for pastoral care; that pattern still holds true today,\" Pushpay researchers noted. \"The vast majority of AI use cases revolve around content generation and editing of communication materials like emails, imagery, and social media posts.\"\n \nContact:[leonardo.blair@christianpost.com] Follow Leonardo Blair on Twitter:[@leoblair] Follow Leonardo Blair on Facebook:[LeoBlairChristianPost] \n## You’ve readarticles in the last 30 days.\n## Was this article helpful?\n**Yes**48 Votes**No**\n## Help keep The Christian Post free for everyone.\nOur work is made possible by the generosity of supporters like you.

            "text": "- [Facebook] \n\n\\|\n[Join Our Newsletter] \\|\n[Search] \n\nCorey Schlosser-Hall, the Presbyterian Church’s deputy executive director, gives introductory remarks Sept. 2 at the Faithful Futures conference, held at Westminster Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Photo: David Paulsen/Episcopal News Service\n\n\\[Episcopal News Service – Minneapolis, Minnesota\\] Some of the most tech-forward minds in the Protestant church gathered here this week at the [Faithful Futures conference], where participants wrestled with the ethical, practical and spiritual implications of artificial intelligence. The Episcopal Church is one of four Protestant denominations that hosted the Sept. 2-5 conference. About halfway through, one of the moderators acknowledged that AI has advanced so far and so rapidly that most conferences on AI are no longer focused just on AI.\n\nThe increasingly pervasive technology is generating increasingly pointed debates: Can AI be harnessed to supercharge efficiency? Will AI worsen economic inequality? Are we treading an ethical minefield by embracing experimental tools developed by profit-driven corporations? How should we respond to the ecological impact of AI’s need for [vast computing power]? And how serious is the threat that AI “hallucinations” could [harm users’ sense of reality] or even [cause them to harm themselves]?\n\nFaithful Futures’ scope was broad enough to pull on all of those threads, tied together in the theme “Guiding AI With Wisdom and Witness” that emphasized how faith communities are called to respond to this AI moment. Amid a wide range of perspectives, one point of consensus was that the church cannot ignore the rise of AI and its implications.\n\n“What does it look like for God to be at the center of these tools?” speaker [Jovonia Taylor-Hayes], a leadership coach and former corporate manager, said in her Sept. 3 keynote. “We should ensure that the technology supports, not replaces, spiritual beliefs.”\n\nThis was the second annual gathering of the Faithful Futures conference, organized by leaders from The Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Presbyterian Church and the United Methodist Church. About 60 participants, split about equally among the four denominations, attended in person at [Westminster Presbyterian Church] in downtown Minneapolis. An additional 300 signed up to view and comment on livestreams of the week’s keynote addresses and moderated discussions.\n\nThe participating denominations also are separately in the process of developing and formalizing churchwide statements and resources to address artificial intelligence. Faithful Futures’ organizers sought to deepen those ongoing conversations, while encouraging a mix of caution and curiosity toward AI.\n\n“It’s natural for people to show up to Faithful Futures wanting to learn more about how to use AI in their church, and I think you will find that here,” Corey Schlosser-Hall, the Presbyterian Church’s deputy executive director, said in his Sept. 2 opening remarks. “But the focus of our time here is less on the ‘how to’ and more in reflecting on the possibilities and the perils of AI as it meets and intersects with the wisdom of God and the witness of God’s people.”\n\nArtificial intelligence has been theorized and pursued for decades, though in the past few years, AI has moved into the forefront of the cultural, political and spiritual conversation, most notably since the [November 2022 release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4]. That and similar chatbots broke new ground with their ability to parse vast troves of data and respond quickly and accurately to queries and to complete tasks, delivering their outputs in conversational language suitable for consumer applications.\n\nMajor tech companies are now in a race to develop and deploy a wide range of AI products, from Google Gemini to Meta AI. Although chatbots may be the AI many people think of first, the underlying technology is [powering countless other tools], from voice transcription and translation services to the automated responses delivered in customer service portals.\n\nIt also is upending consumer behavior. [An Adobe study,] for example, found that use of AI to assist in online shopping has skyrocketed in the past year, with more than half of consumers expected to rely on the technology in 2025 to make purchases.\n\nRobert Willer, the ELCA’s director for theological ethics, told Episcopal News Service that enormity of these changes is greater than we can yet understand. “I think this is transforming society in the way that the Industrial Revolution did,” he said on the first day of the Faithful Futures conference.\n\n**Denominations mobilize for churchwide responses to AI**\n\nWiller is among the Lutheran leaders who now are developing churchwide resources on AI, as mandated by the ELCA’s governing body, the Churchwide Assembly. The Presbyterian Church is engaged in similar work based on a resolution [adopted last year by its General Assembly].\n\n“There’s no rolling back the clock on technology – artificial intelligence is already reshaping the world around us, and like it or not, it’s here to stay,” the United Methodist Church says in [an online resource] compiled by its Discipleship Ministries office.\n\nThe Episcopal Church formed a Task Force on Artificial Intelligence and Intellectual Property in response to [two resolutions adopted in 2024 at the 81st General Convention]. It will report on its findings in 2027 at the next General Convention.\n\nParticipants in the Faithful Futures conference listen to presentations Sept. 3 at Westminster Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Photo: Scott Hughes/United Methodist Church\n\nThe Rev. Lorenzo Lebrija, a [member of the Episcopal task force], serves as chief innovation officer at Virginia Theological Seminary and executive director of the seminary’s [TryTank Research Institute]. He also was the lead Episcopal convener of the Faithful Futures conference, and on Sept. 3 he led a morning discussion on how best to define artificial generative intelligence, or AGI.\n\nHe gave this definition as a starting point: “\\[A\\]n AI system that can learn, reason and perform any intellectual task that a human can.”\n\nA worst-case scenario, Lebrija said, might be that as it learns to complete tasks faster, it also has the potential to rapidly break social systems, which in certain extreme scenarios “would lead to the end of humanity.” If that outcome is possible, people of faith might feel called to add their voice to the debate, he said. “Should we as a church stand up and say, hey, that’s not a good road to go down?”\n\nLebrija’s prompt generated much discussion on the relative threat posed by unchecked AI, with some participants noting that AI also has the ability to help humans achieve previously unimaginable advances in fields like health care and the sciences. Others underscored that whatever the value of AI, it is being hyped by corporations that need to make it profitable. Part of the hype is rooted in the potential to replace human employees with less-expensive automated functions, which could lead to an epidemic of joblessness.\n\nThe Rt. Rev. Nicholas Knisely, bishop of the [Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island] and a member of the Episcopal task force on AI, said he was surprised by some of the results of a survey conducted by the task force. Respondents from older generations were more receptive to AI, perhaps because they grew up seeing technology as beneficial to humanity, from medicine to space travel. Younger generations, on the other hand, were more skeptical of AI and its real-world impact.\n\nKnisely acknowledged that we still don’t know whether AI’s benefits ultimately will outweigh its risks to humanity, but he doesn’t foresee a potential doomsday in the short term. “I’m not worried about it now, and I’m not particularly worried in our lifetime.”\n\nVictoria Linner, on the other hand, voiced some of her generation’s skepticism. At age 27, Linner said she is worried about potential loss of jobs and economic opportunities, if companies conclude the expertise of college graduates can be replaced in the workplace by AI-populated chatbots.\n\nLinner mentioned the Episcopal-affiliated chatbot [AskCathy], now known as [EpiscoBot], which is maintained by Lebrija’s TryTank. The tool answers questions and performs tasks related to The Episcopal Church – it can even produce the text of a service bulletin for Sunday worship on command. Linner, a student at Virginia Theological Seminary, wondered whether a real-life Cathy who previously produced that service bulletin working for her local congregation will now be out of a job.\n\n“Who is going to be impacted the most by AI?” Liner asked. “If entry-level positions are gone, how are you going to start a career?”\n\n**AI raises spiritual questions over what it means to be human**\n\nMuch of the conference seemed to pivot on questions that defied easy answers. In an afternoon session Sept. 3, several church leaders who attended last year’s Faithful Futures conference in Seattle, Washington, were invited to give 10-minute presentations on their preferred topics.\n\n“What happens to theology when the appearance of intelligence is no longer uniquely human?” said the Rev. Michael DeLashmutt, a [theology professor at General Theological Seminary] in New York, New York, who also serves as the Episcopal seminary’s senior vice president.\n\nDeLashmutt argued that people of faith, in an era of AI, must not forget what it means to be Christian and to be human. “Being human means being relational, embodied, justice-oriented and open to God’s spirit,” he said. “So, I think the real risk is not that machines will become human, but that we will forget the fullness of what humanity actually is.”\n\nKip Currier, a [computing and information professor at the University of Pittsburgh], warned that AI is being used by sports betting platforms to appeal to gamblers, including those suffering from addiction. Mark Douglas, an ethics professor at Columbia Theological Seminary, outlined the ecological impact of AI data centers, which need to consume [massive amounts of energy and water].\n\nThe Rev. Andy Morgan, a [Presbyterian pastor based in Knoxville, Tennessee,] described himself as his denomination’s “unofficial AI person” and suggested that preachers should not be afraid of using AI to improve their sermons – as long as they establish boundaries to prevent delegating too much to the technology.\n\nAnd Scott Lyon spoke of his experience founding [Solace], a company that develops digital tools to support spiritual growth. He emphasized that congregations considering whether to add AI to their workflows should understand the “spectrum of trust” before granting the technology autonomy.\n\nAt the “instrumental” level, a congregation might use AI to simplify mundane tasks, like manipulating a mailing list of members, Lyon said. On the other end of the spectrum, Lyon advised extreme caution before delegating full autonomy to an AI tool in public-facing roles, such as a digital evangelism agent interacting with people on the congregation’s behalf on social networks.\n\nThe Rev. Doyt Conn leads a discussion Sept. 4 of the potential impact of AI on how we understand humanity at the Faithful Futures conference. Photo: Scott Hughes/United Methodist Church\n\nThe next day, Sept. 4, the Rev. Doyt Conn, rector of [Epiphany Episcopal Parish] in Seattle, led a morning session that posed another potentially troubling question for the AI era: If an artificial being could be created with human-like skills but without human flaws, then “what does it mean to be human?”\n\nThe group engaged in a lively discussion on hypothetical scenarios, such as whether the AI humanoid could be baptized or even ordained as clergy. Some questioned whether a “natural” human, made by God in the image of God, was still distinct from a synthetic creature made by humans in the image of humans.\n\nThe Rev. Patricia Lyons, who teaches [practical theology at Virginia Theological Seminary], said the debate highlights two competing heresies – that humans are just spirits trapped in physical bodies and, conversely, that humans’ essence can be reduced to those bodies and what they do in the physical world.\n\nChristianity teaches “the human person is a unity between spirit and flesh,” Lyons said, and “the resurrection of the body is the final sign that death cannot break that unity.”\n\nLyons told ENS after the session that she was excited for the church to engage in these debates with both curiosity and ethical concern. She shares some of the concerns but thinks it wrong to elevate fear of AI to the fear of death, which Christians believe Jesus has overcome.\n\n“There’s nothing AI can do to stop the redemption of the world,” she said. “Our witness has to be curiosity, but it has to be curiosity grounded in our responsibility to the common good.”\n\n_– David Paulsen is a senior reporter and editor for Episcopal News Service based in Wisconsin.

From every continent, Christians came together to witness how God is transforming lives and to join in prayer, worship, repentance, and commissioning.\nThis event marks a historic moment for the global Church. For the first time, technology and AI enabled a monumental achievement: live sessions from the United States, New Zealand, Malaysia, Romania, Rwanda, the United Kingdom, and Peru were translated into 87 languages in real time, extending the reach of Gather25 far beyond physical borders.\nWith this expanded reach, Gather25 highlighted powerful stories of salvation from around the world and from the persecuted church. Across the world, speakers delivered a message to Christians across denominations: the Church is not shrinking &#8211; it&#8217;s growing.&#160;\nSelf-organized group gatherings also took place &#8211; from living rooms and remote villages to large gatherings like the one in Cebu City, Philippines, where over 5,000 people gathered outdoors to watch the sessions.\nOver 117,000 prison inmates in the US were able to gather with the global Church through the PandoApp from God Behind Bars. Gather25 participants even got[news from Antarctica], where Christians from the local scientific bases joined together in the local Chapel of the Snows. In addition, TBN aired multiple segments over the course of the weekend, with a global network that reached two billion potential viewers.\nA global lineup of speakers and worship artists that included Jennie Allen, Christine Caine, Tim Godfrey, Sergio Hornung, Matt Maher, Dr. Charles Mugisha, Matt Redman, Sinach, Andres Spyker, Mark Varughese, Rick Warren, Darlene Zschech&#160; and many more also challenged participants to take action&#8212;through prayer, sharing the Gospel, and supporting organizations focused on Bible translation, church planting, pastoral training, and poverty relief.\nJennie Allen, founder and visionary of Gather25 and one of the speakers, reflected on its impact:*&#8220;The only way that this happens &#8211; that denominations come together, countries come together, continents come together &#8211; is because of prayer. What we saw at Gather25 was a picture of heaven&#8212;believers from every nation, tribe, and language coming together with one mission: to make Jesus known.&#8221;*\nFor Pastor Mmbongya in Malawi, the impact of the event was powerful:&#8220;*We thank Jesus for the global Church gathering in Malawi at the Dzaleka refugee camp. We have seen the Holy Spirit move through prayer and worship, with great encounters.&#8221;*\nGather25 was amplified through partnerships with the YouVersion Bible App, Finishing the Task, World Evangelical Alliance, RightNow Media, Bible Gateway, Revive Europe, Arise Asia and many others.\nFor those who missed the gathering, content is available**on-demand**at[live.gather25.com].\nGather25 is just the beginning and will be followed by**Gather27**in**2027**&#8212;register for updates at[gather27.com].&#160;\nTo learn more about**Everybody Everywhere**, the movement introduced at Gather25, and join thousands&#160; of Christians united to pray expectantly, share boldly, and give radically visit[everybodyeverywhere.com].&#160;\n&#160;\n**About Gather25**\nThe original vision for Gather25 was cast by Jennie Allen. The event began in the United States at 01:00 UTC on Saturday, 1 March 2025, and journeyed around the world for 25 hours, concluding in Peru at 02:00 UTC on Sunday, 2 March 2025.\nGather Worship, a collective of artists from across the world, released a multilingual album ahead of the event, titled*Hear The World That You So Love Sing Back To You.*Listen to the full album[**here.**] \nFor a full list of speakers and worship leaders, visit[**gather25.com**].&#160;\nGather25 Socials:[Facebook] |[Instagram] |[YouTube] |[TikTok] &#160;\n&#160;\n**About Everybody Everywhere**\nLong before the vision for Gather25 existed, God was already at work bringing together movements and organizations around a shared vision: to share the gospel everywhere by 2033. Through the work of gathering the global church through Gather25, it&#8217;s become apparent that this is a consistent vision across global ministry movements. The drumbeat is this: the time is now to revive the Church to complete the Great Commission in our lifetime, and it&#8217;s possible.\n**Everybody Everywhere**is a movement of Jesus followers committed to praying and sharing the gospel in neighborhoods and cities all over the world. There are parts of the world where it is difficult to get the gospel and that&#8217;s why the global Church is invited to financially support this vision and the work of partners.\nTo join millions of Christians united to pray expectantly, share boldly, and give radically visit[everybodyeverywhere.com].&#160;\n&#160;\n**About Jennie Allen&#160;**\nJennie Allen, Bible teacher, author, and the visionary behind IF:Gathering, leads a new chapter as the Founder &amp; Visionary of Gather25, a 25-hour global prayer gathering.

The data for the report was collected in February from about 8,000 church leaders.\nAccording to the report, the use of AI has increased by 80% across all ministries in churches, but only for specific tasks.\n“While adoption (of AI) has increased, leaders remain reluctant to rely on AI for pastoral content. Last year’s report revealed that less than one quarter of AI users applied the tool for developing devotionals, sermons, or ideas for pastoral care; that pattern still holds true today,” researchers note. “The vast majority of AI use cases revolve around content generation and editing of communication materials like emails, imagery, and social media posts.”\nWhile they mostly leverage AI to enhance operational efficiency, the research shows that church leaders overwhelmingly used AI to meet their communication needs.\n“These patterns aren’t necessarily surprising. Those called to lead in the Church —many of whom began serving long before AI rose to prominence —pursued their vocation out of [a] desire to lead through the Holy Spirit. As such, AI’s role in spiritual leadership is still being approached with trepidation,” the researchers explain. “But, once the message is ready to be shared, leaders are taking advantage of this next-gen tool to spread that message widely and swiftly.”\nThe findings of the State of the Church Tech 2025 report on AI use come about a month after[Gloo], a leading technology platform connecting the faith ecosystem,[announced] that Pat Gelsinger, the former CEO of multinational technology company Intel, expanded his role at the firm from investor and chairman to executive chairman and head of technology, with a plan to shape technology, particularly AI, toward positive endeavors.\nGloo noted that the faith ecosystem in the U.S., which spans approximately 450,000 churches, faith networks and nonprofits, had been slow to adopt digital technology.\nGelsinger pointed out the slow reaction of the faith community to get involved with consumer social internet platforms which “has not been a positive for society,” and argued that he didn’t want to repeat that mistake with rapidly advancing AI.\n“In this case, this is where we are going, the ability to shape AI as a force for good is enormous. Being able to truly be where faith and technology come together, be an influence for how the church can take advantage of the latest technology but do so in shaping AI as a force for good,” he said.\nAmong other findings, the State of the Church Tech 2025 report also found that a significant share of church leaders, 86%, agree that technology increases connection in their community.\n\"This year’s State of Church Tech report offers more than just statistics and data —it’s a window into the evolving mindset of church leaders,” Kenny Wyatt, Pushpay's CEO, said in a[statement on the report]. “We see overwhelming consensus that technology plays a critical role in ministry, and I’m encouraged by the way churches are approaching it. More and more leaders view these tools as an avenue to enhance, not replace, the human relationships that are so central to the Church.\"\n \nContact:[leonardo.blair@christianpost.com] Follow Leonardo Blair on Twitter:[@leoblair] Follow Leonardo Blair on Facebook:[LeoBlairChristianPost] \n## You’ve readarticles in the last 30 days.\n## Was this article helpful?\n**Yes**7 Votes**No**\n## Help keep The Christian Post free for everyone.\nOur work is made possible by the generosity of supporters like you.

It came as another AI artist, Breaking Rust, did the same on the country digital charts.\n\nJon Huff, worship pastor at Cartersville (Ga.) First Baptist Church, wrote a Facebook post in late November that could speak for many of his peers.\n\nHe had received suggestions from the congregation of songs for the church to sing, but wasn’t sure if people knew they were AI. It concerned him that people may think certain artists are real people when they aren’t.\n\nLike other worship leaders, there was also the concern that such songs did not include the human element.\n\n“These songs are made in seconds by machines. ‘Soul-less’ music,” he wrote.\n\nPersonally, he added, he found the songs “problematic,” and he would be avoiding singing AI-generated content.\n\n“There are many great hymns of the faith, modern hymns and praise choruses available \\[and\\] written by humans with souls,” he added, “but it seems we have to be more discerning than ever these days.”\n\nKevin Uhrich, worship pastor at Westside Baptist Church in Gainesville, Fla., is pretty much in agreement.\n\n“Our worship music from yesterday, and the songs we sing today, not only come from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, but from writers with life experiences,” he said. “AI would never be able to replace the emotion that Horatio Spafford put into ‘It Is Well with My Soul.’ Nor could AI understand the power that comes from setting the Word of God to music and stirring a local congregation to lift their voices.”\n\nUsing AI for production is a different matter with some positives, he said.\n\n“AI can help to generate ideas and stir creativity, but it cannot be a final source for the music sung in worship,” said Uhrich.\n\nThat theme was constant among those contacted by Baptist Press.\n\n“There’s something to the richness from having an embodied experience with the Holy Spirit of God both in planning of worship but also in leading songs for congregational worship,” said Jonathan Welch, assistant professor of _worship_ at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary.\n\n“This whole discussion puts a spotlight on the importance of intentionality and prayerfulness in our song selection for gathered worship,” he said. “There’s an opportunity to remind us of the importance of process. I teach my students that every congregation should have a process for identifying and selecting songs for gathered worship. This whole discussion helps bring attention to those things for churches.\n\n“Maybe it’s a wake-up call for some churches. What are the criteria for selecting music for congregational worship?”\n\nKenny Lamm, Worship Ministries strategist for North Carolina Baptists, said that as new as AI is … it really isn’t as far as Church history goes.\n\n“The Church’s historical posture – from the printing press to the podcast – has generally been utilitarian and adaptive, viewing technology as a powerful tool to serve the timeless mission of sharing the Gospel and cultivating spiritual growth,” Lamm told BP. “The core debate, now as then, centers on whether the tool enhances or distracts from the spiritual experience. That is something each church must wrestle with.”\n\nIn other words, fear isn’t the right response; discernment is.\n\n“I would recommend a slower, better‑informed discernment rather than blanket fear, asking whether God might use new tools – as with earlier media revolutions – while the church holds a hard line that AI can _assist_ the craft but cannot _replace_ the heart and witness of human worshippers,” said Lamm.\n\nEven AI-generated songs should be put to the test and not tossed out wholesale, he continued.\n\n“We always need to filter the songs we put in the hearts and mouths of our congregants to guard their theological integrity and musical beauty,” Lamm said. “What if AI creates songs that pass all the tests and are a wonderful expression for the congregation?”\n\nWelch advocates for a measured approach.\n\n“For this and other topics in the church, the best question often isn’t if something is allowed, but if it is wise,” he said. “To use a humorous example, I could use a kazoo in worship, but should I? We trust our pastors and ministry leaders to discern the best time and locations of tools like AI.”\n\nThe two worship pastors BP spoke with are taking the cautious route for now.\n\n“I’ve seen graphic design work created instantly for free or at the fraction of the cost by AI,” Huff said. “At what point would churches consider having an AI music team or worship experience?”\n\n“There are definitely some positives to using AI in the production of the song, just as many other creative arts will utilize AI to help,” said Uhrick. “However, I personally believe we need to draw the line when it comes to the words written on the page. That must remain the work of a human.”\n\n_This article has been republished with permission from_ [_Baptist Press_] _._\n\n_Scott Barkley is chief national correspondent for Baptist Press._\n\n[Art & Music], [Art and Music], [Arts & Culture], [Christianity], [North America], [Technology] [Scott Barkley] January 3, 2026[Scott Barkley], [news], [art and music], [Christianity], [AI], [artificial intelligence], [technology], [music] [Comment]"

Gather25 will be a 25-hour event hosted both virtually and in person across six continents.\n\nAI translation technology will allow live music, teaching, prayers, and international stories of hope to be shared globally at the same time. Christians can join from their homes, theatres, local churches, or at one of the live broadcast sites.\n\nThe event is being supported by organisations such as YouVersion, The Bible Project, illumiNations and 24-7 Prayer International.\n\nJennie Allen, founder and visionary behind Gather25, said: \"For the first time in history, the entire Church is actually able to gather. We are inviting all 2.5 billion people who love Jesus to come together to pray, to see stories of the Church, and to commission them to become missionaries wherever they are to reach the ends of the earth.\"\n\nAllen told _Premier_ she was inspired to start the project after having a vision of the second coming: \"It was so vivid. I woke up and thought 'What would we do if he was coming back soon?' We'd bring everyone together across the world, and we would be on the same mission, the way that Jesus told us to be.\"\n\nDr Charles Mugisha is the co-founder of Africa New Life Ministries and lead pastor of New Life Bible Church Rwanda. He said: \"Gather25 is an opportunity for God's people to become one, with Christ at the centre.\n\n\"There are billions of people and many people groups, who don't know the love of God – my prayer is that Gather25 would ignite a new commissioning of the Church under the power of the Holy Spirit so that every soul would be reached with the love of God.\"\n\nThe event will take place on 1st March 2025.\n\n### A Monthly Gift Of $11 Makes A World Of Difference\n\nIn a world of fake news there’s never been a greater need for quality Christian journalism.
