Chow] \n\nCorrespondent\n\nAs technologists race to accelerate AI’s progress with minimal guardrails, they are being met with increasing resistance from a powerful global contingent: Christian leaders and their congregations.\n\nChristians are not a monolith by any means. But this year, Christian leaders across sects—including Catholics, Evangelicals, and Baptists—sounded the alarm on AI’s potential impact on family, human relationships, labor, and the church itself. While many of these critics are not anti-technology, they have become concerned with the rapid pace of progress in the face of real-world harms. So they have started urging caution in sermons, [open letters], and private conversations with political leaders, in an attempt to influence both policy debates and the general public’s perception.\n\nWhite evangelicals make up roughly a [quarter of American voters]. Their outspokenness on AI could play a role in the [widening rift] between the tech leaders in Trump’s administration and his MAGA base as the midterms approach next year.\n\n“Christ asked, ‘What does it profit a man to gain the world and lose his soul?,’” says John Litzler, the general counsel and director of public policy at the Baptist General Convention of Texas. “It’s not that Christians are anti-business or anti-growth. But the soul of our country and of the individuals in our country is more important.”\n\n## Pope Leo and Concerns About Child Harms\n\nThe wariness of some Christians towards AI starts at the very top of the Catholic Church. In May, Pope Leo XIV chose his name as a [reference] to a previous technological revolution that upended society. In the months since, he has used his platform to talk about AI’s potential to help spread the Gospel, but also to manipulate children and serve “antihuman ideologies.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n**Read More:** [_Pope Leo’s Name Carries a Warning About the Rise of AI_] \n\nThe following month, a group of influential bishops wrote [a letter] to the U.S. Congress with policy recommendations on AI. Many other Christian leaders have likewise followed his lead. “Leo XIV made it quite clear that he thinks this is something that the church should be speaking to: not just in terms of defining what it is, but also how it should be used,” says Michael Toscano, a Catholic and the director of the Family First Technology Initiative for the Institute for Family Studies.\n\nIn particular, Christian leaders are voicing fears about AI’s impact on families and children. In November, Pastor Michael Grayston at LifeFamily Austin led a discussion at his church about AI risks, touching on the rising usage of AI companions among teens. “If I'm in a crisis and need a person to talk to, it’s my friend AI, which is a lot easier, and means I don’t have to share with my friends,” he told TIME in Bee Cave, Tex., the next day. “So I'm going to keep doing that, and I'm going to become more and more isolated. That's the trajectory that I'm super fearful of.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany Christians also dislike the way that Silicon Valley leaders have used religious language or iconography to support their mission of building God-like machines. The venture capitalist Peter Thiel, for example, has [invoked] the antichrist in lectures, theorizing that such a figure might wield anti-AI sentiment to amass political power. In November, Marc Andreessen [posted a meme] on X that appeared to mock Pope Leo over a post about AI.\n\nAndrea Sparks, the co-founder of Not on Our Watch Texas, an initiative raising awareness of online child exploitation, says that when she heard Thiel’s comments about regulation being part of the antichrist’s mission, “It blew my mind.” She adds: “The Commandments tell us to love God and love one another, and I believe AI companions move us away from that.”\n\n## Anti-Accelerationism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are also Christian leaders who acknowledge the potential benefits of AI tools. Father Michael Baggot, a professor at the Pontifical Athenaeum Regina Apostolorum in Rome, remembers how difficult it was to dive into Catholicism at the beginning of his religious journey. He now serves as an advisor to Magisterium AI, a chatbot app designed to answer questions about Catholicism and faith. “It is accessible 24/7 in a way that no priest or professor is available, and provides very clear and concise summaries of topics that can be a bit confusing or difficult to approach,” he says.\n\nBut while Baggot sees clear use cases—such as [translating the Bible] into different languages—he has also grown disenchanted with the tech industry’s priority to accelerate AI tools regardless of the risks, particularly to children. He has taught courses about the dangers of AI companions and offered counsel to [Megan Garcia], whose son, Sewell Setzer, died by suicide in 2024 after becoming romantically obsessed with a chatbot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is also troubled by the AI industry’s intention to displace workers. (Elon Musk, for example, has [predicted] that work will be rendered “optional” by AI.) “The church emphasizes that labor is important not only for what it produces, but because of the process of interior growth and community ties that it fosters,” he says. “I don't think it's enough to simply throw money at \\[displaced workers\\] and to tell them to get out of the way so that the rest of society can move forward.”\n\nNina Lutz, a PhD student at the University of Washington, recently worked on a project in which she interviewed 40 faith leaders about their relationship with technology. She heard many concerns, especially about AI accelerationism. “This notion that we are going to invest everything into AI and push it through as fast as possible, a lot of religious stakeholders found that really concerning,” she says. “They felt as though religious and other communities were being left behind.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Getting involved in policy\n\nThese concerns have led some Christian leaders to become active in public policy, urging politicians to enact AI guardrails. This puts them in opposition to Donald Trump and his tech allies, who urge a light-touch approach. In May, Evangelical leaders [sent] an open letter to Trump warning of the dangers of out-of-control artificial intelligence and of automating human labor. In November, a coalition of 43 faith leaders [sent] a letter to Congress, urging lawmakers not to preempt state AI laws in this year’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). A [separate coalition] that included the National Association of Evangelicals urged the House to rein in AI chatbots.\n\nChris MacKenzie, vice president of communications at the Americans for Responsible Innovation, says that the mission of his AI safety-focused nonprofit has been boosted by the outspokenness of faith leaders. “Some members of Congress, especially on the right, are really guided by their faith,” he says. “So faith leaders have a real impact in speaking to those people.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Toscano, at the Institute for Family Studies, has embarked on a similar mission. He co-runs the Faith Family Technology network, a weekly convening of public policy authors, technologists, academics, and religious leaders of many faiths, in an attempt to shape AI’s present and future. “Our basic view that an attempt to develop artificial intelligence without reference to the wisdom of religious communities is doomed to create something that will not be good for people,” he says.\n\nThe network has exerted its influence in major AI policy battles this year. Members wrote and circulated letters from faith leaders criticizing [preemption efforts]; backchanneled with the team behind the podcast Steve Bannon’s War Room, a major voice against the AI [moratorium] from the GOP’s right flank; and put together a policy working group that shaped the final text of [Josh Hawley’s AI companions bill].\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrad Littlejohn, the network's co-leader, says that an increasing number of conservative Christians are now realizing that they are not in alignment with the Trump administration’s accelerationist approach to AI. And because they make up such a large demographic in the U.S., their influence could undermine politicians’ efforts to push forward AI without any guardrails in the coming years. “Before, they really cared that Trump won the battle against censorship. But it wasn't obvious to people that the battle over censorship wasn't the big battle,” he says. “The really big battle was coming over AI.”\n\n## Must-Reads from TIME\n\n- [Pope Leo Calls His Appointment a Cross and a Blessing in First Mass as Pontiff] \n\n- [The Cultural Impact of Notre Dame Football Goes Far Beyond the Playing Field] \n\n- [What Exactly Is Trump’s Religious Liberty Commission—and Why Have Some Experts Raised Concerns?] \n\n- [Pope Leo’s Name Carries a Warning About the Rise of AI] \n\n- [Trump’s Cuts to The Department of Education Are Part of a Long Fight by Conservative Christians] \n\n- [With Letter to Trump, Evangelical Leaders Join the AI Debate] \n\n\n- [Pope Leo Calls His Appointment a Cross and a Blessing in First Mass as Pontiff] \n\n- [The Cultural Impact of Notre Dame Football Goes Far Beyond the Playing Field] \n\n- [What Exactly Is Trump’s Religious Liberty Commission—and Why Have Some Experts Raised Concerns?] \n\n\nRead More"

But the practice raises new questions about who, or what, is guiding the flock.\n* New AI-powered apps allow you to \"text with Jesus\" or \"talk to the Bible,\" giving the impression you are communicating with a deity or angel.\n* Other apps can create personalized prayers, let you confess your sins or offer religious advice on life's decisions.\n* \"What could go wrong?\" Robert P. Jones, CEO of the nonpartisan[Public Religion Research Institute], sarcastically asks.\n**State of play:**The U.S. could see an unprecedented[15,000 churches] shut their doors this year as a[record number of Americans (29%)] now are identifying as religiously unaffiliated.\n* Megachurches are consolidating the remaining faithful, but even the most charismatic pastors struggle to offer private counseling with such large congregations.\n**Zoom in:**In recent months, churches have been deploying chatbots to answer frequently asked questions such as service times and event details, and even to share scripture.\n* [EpiscoBot], a chatbot developed by the[TryTank Research Institute] for the Episcopal Church, responds to spiritual or faith-related queries, drawing on church resources.\n* Other AI apps analyze[congregational data] (attendance and engagement) to tailor outreach and communications.\n* And more[pastors] are admitting that they use AI to assist in[creating sermons] or reduce writing time.\n**What they're saying: \"**Every church or house of worship is a business.

(CNS photo/Vatican Media)\nThe popes and Vatican institutions, particularly the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, have been monitoring and raising concerns about the development and use of artificial intelligence for more than 40 years.\n\"Like any product of human creativity, AI can be directed toward positive or negative ends,\" the Vatican document said. \"When used in ways that respect human dignity and promote the well-being of individuals and communities, it can contribute positively to the human vocation.\"\n\"Yet, as in all areas where humans are called to make decisions, the shadow of evil also looms here,\" the dicasteries said. \"Where human freedom allows for the possibility of choosing what is wrong, the moral evaluation of this technology will need to take into account how it is directed and used.\"\nHuman beings, not machines, make moral decisions, the document said. So, \"it is important that ultimate responsibility for decisions made using AI rests with the human decision-makers and that there is accountability for the use of AI at each stage of the decision-making process.\"\nThe Vatican document insisted that while artificial intelligence can quickly perform some very complex tasks or access vast amounts of information, it is not truly intelligent, at least not in the same way human beings are.\n![Cardinal Tolentino de Mendonca at a news conference] Cardinal José Tolentino de Mendonça, prefect of the Dicastery for Culture and Education, speaks at a Vatican news conference in this file photo from Oct. 17, 2023. (CNS photo/Lola Gomez)\n\"A proper understanding of human intelligence,\" it said, \"cannot be reduced to the mere acquisition of facts or the ability to perform specific tasks. Instead, it involves the person's openness to the ultimate questions of life and reflects an orientation toward the true and the good.\"\nHuman intelligence also involves listening to others, empathizing with them, forming relationships and making moral judgments -- actions which even the most sophisticated AI programs cannot do, it said.\n\"Between a machine and a human, only the human can be sufficiently self-aware to the point of listening and following the voice of conscience, discerning with prudence, and seeking the good that is possible in every situation,\" the document said.\nThe Vatican dicasteries issued several warnings or cautions in the document, calling on individual users, developers and even governments to exercise control over how AI is used and to commit \"to ensuring that AI always supports and promotes the supreme value of the dignity of every human being and the fullness of the human vocation.\"\n![Cardinal Fernandez speaks at a Vatican news conference] Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, speaks to reporters at the Vatican in this file photo from Sept. 19, 2024. (CNS photo/Justin McLellan)\nFirst, they said, \"misrepresenting AI as a person should always be avoided; doing so for fraudulent purposes is a grave ethical violation that could erode social trust. Similarly, using AI to deceive in other contexts -- such as in education or in human relationships, including the sphere of sexuality -- is also to be considered immoral and requires careful oversight to prevent harm, maintain transparency, and ensure the dignity of all people.\"\nThe dicasteries warned that \"AI could be used to perpetuate marginalization and discrimination, create new forms of poverty, widen the 'digital divide,' and worsen existing social inequalities.\"\nWhile AI promises to boost productivity in the workplace \"by taking over mundane tasks,\" the document said, \"it frequently forces workers to adapt to the speed and demands of machines rather than machines being designed to support those who work.\"\nParents, teachers and students also need to be careful with their reliance on AI, it said, and they need to know its limits.\n\"The extensive use of AI in education could lead to the students' increased reliance on technology, eroding their ability to perform some skills independently and worsening their dependence on screens,\" it said.\nAnd while AI may provide information, the document said, it does not actually educate, which requires thinking, reasoning and discerning.\n![The ChatGPT app on a phone] The ChatGPT app is seen on a phone placed atop a keyboard in this photo taken in Rome March 8, 2024. (CNS photo/Lola Gomez)\nUsers must also be aware of AI's \"serious risk of generating manipulated content and false information, which can easily mislead people due to its resemblance to the truth. Such misinformation might occur unintentionally, as in the case of AI 'hallucination,' where a generative AI system yields results that appear real but are not\" because it is programmed to respond to every request for information, regardless of whether it has access to it.\nOf course, the document said, AI's falsehood also \"can be intentional: individuals or organizations intentionally generate and spread false content with the aim to deceive or cause harm, such as 'deepfake' images, videos and audio -- referring to a false depiction of a person, edited or generated by an AI algorithm.\"\nMilitary applications of AI technology are particularly worrisome, the document said, because of \"the ease with which autonomous weapons make war more viable,\" AI's potential for removing \"human oversight\" from weapons deployment and the possibility that autonomous weapons will become the object of a new \"destabilizing arms race, with catastrophic consequences for human rights.\n## CATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE\nWith its Rome bureau founded in 1950, Catholic News Service has been providing complete, in-depth coverage of the popes and the Vatican for more than 70 years.

(CNS photo/Vatican Media)\nSince the beginning of his pontificate, the pope has emphasized the need for ethically grounded AI, but his message to the conference marked the first time he directly linked the technology's promise to the church's missionary work.\nForum organizers said the stakes are high, as AI tools increasingly shape how people seek meaning online.\n\"There are billions of people who do not yet know Christ and the truth that Christianity fully possesses,\" said Matthew Sanders, a Catholic AI developer and one of the event's organizers. \"If the church's guiding hand is not there, this technology has the power to do unimaginable harm, amplifying confusion and despair.\"\nRegistration materials listed roughly 200 participants, including software engineers, venture capital partners, Catholic media producers, bishops and Vatican communications officials. The forum was structured as a working summit rather than a public conference, with most discussions held in small-group workshops.\nThe registration list included representatives from Microsoft, Palantir Technologies and Goldman Sachs, alongside Catholic filmmakers and ministry leaders. Actor and producer Lorenzo Henrie -- who is currently co-financing and starring as an apostle in Mel Gibson's \"The Resurrection of the Christ,\" now filming in Italy -- was also listed among those participating.\nAfter opening remarks, participants broke into six working groups, each tasked with addressing a specific challenge. Topics ranged from AI in Catholic education to whether the church should attempt to devise a \"Catholic Turing Test\" for identifying signs of consciousness in advanced systems.\nInterest appeared particularly strong in the \"Building and Scaling Catholic AI\" workshop, which drew about half of the forum's participants, and was focused on using AI for evangelization.\n\"We're starting to leverage AI to impart the truth of the Catholic faith,\" Sanders told Catholic News Service Nov. 6. \"But there's more to the faith than just imparting truth. There's the pastoral, human dimension,\" he said.\nA recurring concern was how to help people move from digital encounters with Catholic content into lived parish life.\n![AI conference at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome] Participants at the 2025 Builders AI Forum gather at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome Nov. 6-7, 2025, to discuss how emerging technologies can serve the church’s mission.

Without support, he said, new believers may struggle to find a worshiping community.\n\"The question is how do we 'off-ramp' people from products like Magisterium AI and help ensure that they can find either a community or show them how the faith is lived,\" Sanders said.\nThe goal, he added, is to connect people to a tradition or practice that resonates -- whether Eucharistic adoration, charismatic Mass or the Latin Mass -- so they are accompanied rather than left isolated.\nIn another workshop, \"AI for Faithful Christian Storytelling in Media,\" filmmakers, writers and digital creators discussed how AI might help broaden the reach of Catholic narratives.\nFor Eike Petersen of Aid to the Church in Need, the problem is not a lack of meaningful stories but a lack of visibility.\n\"From a communications perspective, there's so much good work the church is doing for persecuted Christians around the world,\" Petersen told participants. \"But this is really something I think we can scale with AI.\"\nPetersen said he hoped the workshop would clarify \"what the technology is that's needed for that and how to approach it,\" particularly in regions where digital outreach could expand awareness and solidarity.\n## CATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE\nWith its Rome bureau founded in 1950, Catholic News Service has been providing complete, in-depth coverage of the popes and the Vatican for more than 70 years.

(OSV News illustration/Dado Ruvic, Reuters)\nAs the United States and China vie for primacy in the field of artificial intelligence, the Vatican today issued a wide-ranging reflection, called a “Note,” on “the relationship between Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence” that addresses “the anthropological and ethical challenges raised by AI” and warns against “creating a substitute for God.”\nKnown by its Latin title, “[Antiqua] [et Nova] ” from the opening words of the text—“with wisdom both ancient [antiqua] and new [nova]”—the 30-page document said that “there is broad consensus that AI marks a new and significant phase in humanity’s engagement with technology, placing it at the heart of what Pope Francis has described as an ‘epochal change.’”\nIt noted that “[A.I.’s] impact is felt globally and in a wide range of areas, including interpersonal relationships, education, work, art, healthcare, law, warfare, and international relations.”\n“As AI advances rapidly toward even greater achievements,” the note said, “it is critically important to consider its anthropological and ethical implications. This involves not only mitigating risks and preventing harm but also ensuring that its applications are used to promote human progress and the common good.”\nThe document is the result of a joint effort by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, headed by the Argentine cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, and the Dicastery for Culture and Education, led by the Portuguese cardinal José Tolentino de Mendonça.\nThe text was approved by Pope Francis on Jan. 14, and released today in Italian, Spanish and English. While breaking little new ground, it brings together in one document of 117 paragraphs relevant input from the early and more recent Christian tradition, as well as from the Second Vatican Council and the magisterial teachings of Popes Paul VI, John Paul II and Benedict XVI. It draws especially on the teachings of Pope Francis, who has given great attention to A.I. throughout his pontificate and delivered the keynote address on the subject to the G7 meeting in southern Italy, on June 14, 2024.\nThe Vatican said it is offering these anthropological and ethical reflections to contribute to the ongoing global debate concerning A.I. and to assist those entrusted with transmitting the faith—including parents, teachers, pastors and bishops.\n### **Human intelligence vs. artificial intelligence**\nThe text begins “by distinguishing between concepts of intelligence in AI and in human intelligence.”\nIt recalled how the concept of “intelligence” in A.I. has evolved over time and that “a significant milestone occurred in 1956 when the American computer scientist John McCarthy organized a summer workshop at Dartmouth University to explore the problem of ‘Artificial Intelligence,’ which he defined as ‘that of making a machine behave in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving.’ That workshop launched a research program focused on designing machines capable of performing tasks typically associated with the human intellect and intelligent behavior.”\nSince then, it said, “AI research has advanced rapidly,” and, as a result, “many tasks once managed exclusively by humans are now entrusted to AI” and “many researchers aspire to develop what is known as ‘Artificial General Intelligence’ (AGI)—a single system capable of operating across all cognitive domains and performing any task within the scope of human intelligence.” Commenting on this, the Vatican noted that underlying this project “is the implicit assumption that the term ‘intelligence’ can be used in the same way to refer to both human intelligence and AI.” But, it remarked, “In the case of humans, intelligence is a faculty that pertains to the person in his or her entirety, whereas in the context of AI, ‘intelligence’ is understood functionally.”\n“Although advanced AI systems can ‘learn’ through processes such as machine learning,” the Vatican said, “this sort of training is fundamentally different from the developmental growth of human intelligence, which is shaped by embodied experiences, including sensory input, emotional responses, social interactions, and the unique context of each moment.” Moreover, “AI cannot currently replicate moral discernment or the ability to establish authentic relationships.”\n### **Ethical development of A.I.**\nPart IV of the Vatican document is devoted to “the role of ethics in guiding the development and use of AI.” It acknowledged that while technology has “remedied countless evils…not all technological advancements in themselves represent genuine human progress.” It restated the church’s opposition “to those applications [of technology] that threaten the sanctity of life or the dignity of the human person.” Like any human endeavor, it said, “technological development must be directed to serve the human person and contribute to the pursuit of greater justice, more extensive fraternity, and a more humane order of social relations.”\nThe Vatican, which has hosted several meetings on A.I. over the past decade, reported that “concerns about the ethical implications of technological development are shared not only within the church but also among many scientists, technologists, and professional associations, who increasingly call for ethical reflection to guide this development responsibly.”\nIt recalled that Pope Francis told the G7: “Technological products reflect the worldview of their developers, owners, users, and regulators, and have the power to ‘shape the world and engage consciences on the level of values.’… Therefore, the ends and the means used in a given application of AI, as well as the overall vision it incorporates, must all be evaluated to ensure they respect human dignity and promote the common good.”\n### **Social impacts of A.I.**\nPart V of the text deals with a number of specific questions, starting with A.I. and society. It recognized that “while AI holds many possibilities for promoting the good, it can also hinder or even counter human development and the common good.” It recalled that Pope Francis said: “[E]vidence to date suggests that digital technologies have increased inequality in our world. Not just differences in material wealth, which are also significant, but also differences in access to political and social influence” as well as “creating new forms of poverty.”\nIn this context, the Vatican document said that “the concentration of the power over mainstream AI applications in the hands of a few powerful companies raises significant ethical concerns.” It said, “Such entities, motivated by their own interests, possess the capacity to exercise forms of control as subtle as they are invasive, creating mechanisms for the manipulation of consciences and of the democratic process.”\nThe Vatican also warned that A.I. could further isolate people or “hinder a true encounter with reality.” Speaking of A.I., the economy and labor, the Vatican noted that A.I. is being increasingly integrated into economic and financial systems and warned that a few “large corporations” may stand to profit from A.I. more than “the businesses that use it.” It added that “while AI promises to boost productivity by taking over mundane tasks, it frequently forces workers to adapt to the speed and demands of machines rather than machines being designed to support those who work.”\nIn a section devoted to A.I. and health care, the Vatican acknowledged that while A.I. holds “immense potential in a variety of applications” in medicine, it should “enhance” but not “replace the relationship between patients and healthcare providers.”\nSimilarly, speaking of A.I. and education, the Vatican emphasized “that the physical presence of a teacher creates a relational dynamic that AI cannot replicate.” At the same time, it said, “AI presents both opportunities and challenges. If used in a prudent manner, within the context of an existing teacher-student relationship and ordered to the authentic goals of education, AI can become a valuable educational source.”\nThe Vatican also acknowledged the danger of A.I.-generated misinformation and deepfakes, warning that these could “gradually undermine the foundations of society” by “fueling political polarization and social unrest.” It called for “careful regulation” of A.I.-generated media.\nSpeaking to one of the most common criticisms of A.I., the amount of energy and water it requires and its significant contributions to CO2 levels, the Vatican said, “It is vital to develop sustainable solutions that reduce their impact on our common home.” It also listed some ways that A.I. could be used to protect the environment, including by supporting sustainable agriculture, optimizing energy usage, and providing early warning systems for public health emergencies.\nThe document next focused on A.I. and warfare. It recalled Pope Francis’ words in the 2024 Message for the World Day of Peace that “the ability to conduct military operations through remote control systems has led to a lessened perception of the devastation caused by those weapon systems and the burden of responsibility for their use, resulting in an even more cold and detached approach to the immense tragedy of war.”\nThe last topic raised by the Vatican document related to A.I. and humanity’s relationship with God. Here it stated that “the presumption of substituting God for an artifact of human making is idolatry, a practice Scripture explicitly warns against (e.g., Ex. 20:4; 32:1-5; 34:17). Moreover, AI may prove even more seductive than traditional idols for, unlike idols that ‘have mouths but do not speak; eyes, but do not see; ears, but do not hear’ (Ps. 115:5-6), AI can ‘speak,’ or at least gives the illusion of doing so (cf. Rev. 13:15).”\nIt concluded:\n> It is vital to remember that AI is but a pale reflection of humanity—it is crafted by human minds, trained on human-generated material, responsive to human input, and sustained through human labor. AI cannot possess many of the capabilities specific to human life, and it is also fallible. By turning to AI as a perceived ‘Other’ greater than itself, with which to share existence and responsibilities, humanity risks creating a substitute for God. However, it is not AI that is ultimately deified and worshipped, but humanity itself—which, in this way, becomes enslaved to its own work.\nThis article appears in[April 2025].\n### *Related*\n* [Share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook] \n* [Share on X (Opens in new window)X] \n* [Share on Mail (Opens in new window)Mail] \n[![oconnell]] \n## [Gerard O’Connell] \nGerard O’Connell is**America**’s senior Vatican correspondent and author of*The Election of Pope Francis: An Inside Story of the Conclave That Changed History*.

(CNS photo/Carol Glatz)\nVATICAN CITY (CNS) -- Aimed at reaching out to people unable to go to Rome for the Holy Year and helping the millions who are expected to visit St. Peter's Basilica, the Vatican teamed up with Microsoft and other specialized experts to create[a \"digital twin\" of the church for an immersive and more meaningful experience].\nSt. Peter's Basilica will be[launching a new website] to feature the virtual views, streaming services of religious celebrations and podcasts of prayerful meditations as well as an app Dec. 1, that will help visitors with suggested itineraries, audio guides and real-time updates about the lines to the Holy Door and other sites.\nAlso, in January, young students around the world will be able to explore the basilica on Microsoft's game-based learning platform, Minecraft Education.\n![gambetti] Cardinal Mauro Gambetti, archpriest of St. Peter's Basilica, speaks at a news conference at the Vatican Nov. 11, 2024. (CNS photo/Justin McLellan)\nThe multiple projects use AI technology to help people weave together the historical, artistic and spiritual meanings connected with the world's largest church, Cardinal Mauro Gambetti, archpriest of the basilica, told reporters at a Vatican news conference Nov. 11.\nThe \"digital ecosystem,\" he said, will accompany visitors and help them have a more spiritual experience.\nThe cardinal said the idea to create the new services emerged when he and Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, were admiring Michelangelo's La Pieta' statue together in the basilica in 2022 and decided it would be important to share the meaning of these ancient and important works of art in a way that is \"understandable and accessible\" to more people.\nSmith said it also flowed from the fact the tech giant has been working closely with Vatican officials since 2018 starting with the \"Rome Call for AI Ethics,\" a commitment by global organizations to follow key ethical principles in today's emerging technologies.\nThe tech company's \"AI for Good\" lab uses AI to model and create digital representations of any physical body, be it a factory, a building or an entire city. And \"Microsoft had done similar work elsewhere in Europe,\" he said, by creating a 3D-holographic form of France's Mont-Saint-Michel.\n![brad smith] Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, speaks at a news conference at the Vatican Nov. 11, 2024. (CNS photo/Justin McLellan)\nWorking with Iconem, a French startup specializing in the digitization of important cultural sites in 3D, experts used cameras, laser scanners and two drones for one month in 2023 to capture almost half a million high-resolution images of St. Peter's Basilica, Smith said.\nThey collected 22 terabytes of data, which would need almost 5,000 DVDs to record all that data. To comprehend what 5,000 DVDs look like, they would be more than 18 feet (5.62 meters) high if stacked one on top of another -- about the height of a two-story building.\nSophisticated AI technology was used to piece all those photos together, he said. The tech is so new that it was not available even two and a half years ago \"when we started talking about this project.\"\nThe result is viewers can explore the basilica from top to bottom, getting closeup looks even of St. Peter's tomb below, and workers at the basilica can identify previously unseen cracks, missing tiles or other potential repairs needing attention, Smith said.\nThe basilica will also be offering two new immersive exhibits. One is on the roof of the basilica in which high-resolution images of the basilica are cast on the cement dome of the cupola and the other is along the windowed corridor looking over the interior of the basilica showing a series of images about the history of the church, which will be celebrating the 400th anniversary of its consecration in 1626 after construction began in 1506.\n![pencil] Notes written in pencil can be seen on the wall inside an upper floor corridor of St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican Nov. 11, 2024. The notes were left by maintenance workers who had to rappel out of the windows in order to do work on the interior of the basilica for the Holy Year 1900 and for preparations in 1899. (CNS photo/Carol Glatz)\nThe exhibit also features testimonies written in pencil on the walls by basilica workers from the past who would launch themselves from the upper floors by rope in order to rappel down to do cleaning and restoration work on the mosaics and frescos below. *Correction: An earlier version of this story reported a misstatement made by Brad Smith about the amount of image data gathered during the project.

The 39-page document outlines a list of general principles that Christian leaders should consider when interacting with AI, as well as several scenarios that churches may encounter as the prevalence of AI technology increases.\nThe document condemns any efforts to use AI to \"seek to short-circuit or cut short the process of maturation and development of wisdom.\" It warns against the use of \"AI-drafted sermons,\" asserting that \"AI can assist the pastor in preparation, but it should never be used to replace or substitute for the distinct calling upon the man of God to preach God's Word to God's people.\"\n\"The process of sermon development is one of the ways that God refreshes and refines the heart of the preacher,\" the guide reads. \"If it is short-circuited, valuable and personal engagement with the text is lost. As a general rule, these tools are best to use once one has done the hard work of exegesis and research, a process which must be bathed in prayer and personal reflection.\"\nThe document's goal is to \"equip pastors and ministry leaders as they seek to shepherd their people amid these pressing issues, ranging from the family and education to business and ministry,\" ERLC Senior Fellow Jason Thacker said in a statement.\n\"As we know, we can no longer keep the issues surrounding the ethical use of AI at arm's length,\" said Thacker. \"These issues now affect all of us in profound ways as technology continues to shape every aspect of our lives —both for good and ill.\"\nRaShan Frost, ERLC director of research and senior fellow, stressed that \"technological advances are outpacing our understanding of them and at times how we think about the moral and ethical implications of arriving technologies.\"\n\"Thankfully, God's Word provides us with timeless insights, commands and principles to draw from to guide us in all aspects of life and faith,\" Frost said.\nThe guide helps \"take God's Word, and from it draw out theological and ethical principles to help us navigate a world with artificial intelligence\" and \"take those principles and think through practical scenarios that pastors, lay leaders, staff members, and congregants may experience,\" Frost continued.\nRegarding the prospect of church leaders employing AI assistants, the guide advises against the use of AI in a way that ends up \"replacing key aspects of another person's ministry,\" once again maintaining that the technology should only be used as a supplement.\n\"We must never seek to employ AI and other emerging technologies in ways that diminish the dignity of any human being by using AI as a means to subvert the human calling as image bearers of God to shape the world around them,\" the document declares. \"AI must only be used in ways that complement [the] holistic transformation\" that results from the \"godly\" development of \"the whole person, including our minds, bodies, and hearts.\"\nAdditionally, the guide warns that AI \"should never be a substitute for or replacement for a rich embodied community, ultimately with God and with other human beings.\"\n\"Any faithful approach to AI and emerging technologies must be rooted in the transcendent nature of God and his sovereign control over all things, including even the most advanced AI systems,\" the guide states.\nThe document stresses that technologies, including AI, \"must only be developed, deployed, evaluated, and used in ways that champion the immeasurable dignity of all people.\"\nAs the world debates how to respond to the rapid development of AI technology, The Christian Post, Colorado Christian University and Gloo will co-host a summit on Oct. 7 titled \"[AI For Humanity: Navigating Ethics and Morality for a Flourishing Future].\"\nThe event, which will take place at Colorado Christian University in Lakewood, Colorado, will feature \"keynote addresses, panel discussions and interactive sessions designed to equip Christian higher education institutions, students and tech innovators with strategies to responsibly integrate AI within a faith-informed framework.\"\n \nRyan Foley is a reporter for The Christian Post.

ChatGPT, the most famous of large language models (LLMs)—programs that can function as chatbots, create content, and perform administrative tasks based on conversational instructions from users—launched in late 2022. Since then, LLMs have rapidly progressed in their capabilities and are increasingly integrated into our digital lives.\nBut should they be[integrated into] our*spiritual*lives? Should[pastors use] LLMs to[write sermons] or[reformat sermon content] into small-group study guides? Should church websites have chatbots on hand to answer visitors’ questions around the clock? Is there a role for AI in[discipleship and catechesis]?\nMy own answer (others at CT may hold different views) to all those questions is*no.*While I do see some practical uses for AI—like transcribing the dialogue below, with a backstop of full human review—I’m deeply wary of proposals to bring LLMs and similar AI tools into the life of the church. I believe that chatbots have no place in spiritual formation or pastoral care and that even many simpler applications, like telling a potential visitor when the Sunday service starts, are already amply handled by regular old websites.\n## Sign up for The Daily Briefing\nGet the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily.\nEmail\\*Sign Up\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google[Privacy Policy] and[Terms of Service] apply.\nThanks for signing up.\nExplore[more newsletters] —don&#8217;t forget to start your[free 60-day trial of CT] to get full access to all articles in every newsletter.\nSorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\nThose instincts made me curious about Gloo, a dominant player in the “Christian AI” space. The Colorado-based company brands itself as “the leading technology platform dedicated to connecting the faith ecosystem,”[and last summer] it announced $110 million in new venture capital funding.\n[Gloo promises] “AI you can trust for life’s biggest questions,” a chatbot that “guides you to real answers and next steps for a life that matters.” An animation on its site suggests that users ask the chatbot “anything” about the Bible, politics, religion, relationships, and more.\nGloo offers “verified” answers from “reliable sources” that are “biblically sound” and “grounded in faith-based principles” so it can “guide you and those you care about with confidence.” But equally—[on the same page, in the same list] —the company offers personalization so individual users can get answers that reflect what they already believe.\n“Customize your experience with filters that align with your values, ensuring every result reflects what matters most to you,” the site says next to an illustration apparently suggesting users can reject an information source for their personal AI interface.\nThis language left me wondering what it means to make[what Gloo calls] “values-aligned” AI. The company first connected me to its chief AI officer, Steele Billings. Our conversation centered on the technology, and Billings explained that Gloo uses Microsoft’s[Responsible AI], then layers its own standards and training data from Christian sources on top.\nThat starts with Harvard’s[Global Flourishing Study], which[defines human flourishing] in[six dimensions]: “happiness and life satisfaction, physical and mental health, meaning and purpose, character and virtue,” “close social relationships,” and “financial and material stability.” To that list, with help from evangelical polling firm the Barna Group, Billings told me, Gloo added a seventh dimension of faith and spirituality.\n[![Three ovals containing hands holding glowing points of light on an orange background.]] \nrelated### [Measuring the Good Life] \nBrendan Case, Katelyn N. G. Long, Tyler J. VanderWeele, and Byron R. Johnson\nOf course, people of faith are famously prone to disagreement about the truth—thus the personalization. Gloo tools can be customized by individual, congregational and denominational users, Billings said: “One of the things that our technology does is it will go out when a church signs up” and “pull the statement of faith off the church website” so it can “answer questions that are aligned with that statement of faith.”\nThat customization even extends outside the church, Billings confirmed when I asked about other religions, like Judaism or Islam. “While today you would see mostly Protestant organizations on our platform,” he told me, “we do not prohibit in any way a Muslim organization from coming in and using our technology.”\nLater this spring, I also spoke with Brad Hill, Gloo’s chief solutions officer. That conversation, which turned from the technical details to Gloo’s philosophy of AI development and function, is below. It has been edited and condensed.\nEditor’s note: Christianity Today has partnered with Gloo on advertising projects in the past, including the development of branded content about[AI and the church]. These projects have never involved CT’s editorial team and had no influence on this article.\nI’d like to focus here on some higher-level questions about the purpose, goals, and visions that Gloo has for the Kingdom-Aligned Large Language Model (KALLM) and for your work with churches in particular. Let’s start with something your colleague, Steele Billings, said when we spoke about the technical side of this work: “Technology is neutral,” and it’s about what we choose to do with it, what kind of worldview we bring to that task, whether it’s a biblical worldview. Is that Gloo’s mindset? If yes, what does that look like? How do you think about it?\nThat’s a great starting point. Yes, that is what we would contend: The technology is neutral.\nPut another way, I’ve heard it described as amoral. It’s neither good nor bad. It can certainly be applied for things that are quite bad, but also it can be applied for things that are incredibly good and incredibly redemptive.\nOur contention is that in every other station of culture, wherever we look in the world, technology is being used. And our strong belief is that the church—and those in ministry and, as we would say, the faith and flourishing ecosystem—needs to be equipped with the very same tools for good. It’s important. It&#8217;s not a “nice to have” anymore.\nOne reason is that technology is more than just tools, bits and bytes. It’s shaping culture. Look at what happened with social media over the last decade plus. Look at the internet and how it’s affected every station of life. AI is now a very similar phenomenon that’s upon us. So while the technology itself might be classified as neutral, we would contend strongly that people who are in the business of flourishing and people who are trying to advance good need to be equipped with the very best tech so that they can apply it to that end.\n[![]] \nrecommended### [AI Will Shape Your Soul] \n[Kate Lucky] \nIf I can probe that a little bit, I think there are many uses of AI that are pretty uncontroversial: people who use it as a search engine, for example, or administrative functions like scheduling meetings. Where it tends to be controversial, as you no doubt know, is around creating material—for instance, writing sermons or study guides based on sermons. And so that affirmation that the technology is neutral, is that truly across-the-board for Gloo? Or are there areas that you would say are off-limits?\nIt’s an interesting question, and I think honestly there are different answers to that question depending on whether you have AI tools that are built with a values alignment or not.\nWe don’t say technology is neutral if we’re dealing with tools that just have a general-market use, which is mostly what the public is familiar with right now. Even your example that was somewhat innocuous—of using ChatGPT as a search engine—I would contend that’s*not*neutral, because most folks may not fully understand where ChatGPT is getting its results, and those results are likely not aligned to the values of someone who follows Christianity or adheres to biblical truth. If you ask questions on matters of ethics and deeply felt needs, you may get answers that are antithetical to Scripture.\nHowever, when you have tools that are built on more of a biblical foundation and aligned to human flourishing values, I would say my answer broadens regarding what’s within bounds. Because then you feel a lot more confident turning to these tools to answer questions around some of those weightier issues. That’s exactly what we see at Gloo.\nRight now, there’s a gap in the market for generative AI tools that are trained on the values we hold. So for instance, I could ask ChatGPT to help me plan dinner. I think ChatGPT is a wonderful tool for that or for scheduling, as you said. But when we’re asking these weightier questions around faith, ethics, and morality, we want tools built on a model that’s been trained on proper values.\nAnd that’s what Gloo is building now. We’re ultimately not looking to fully*replace*tools like ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini but to*complement*them and leverage the good that’s in all of them so that we have an incredible tool that can tell me what to make for dinner*and*can help me as a parent or in a relationship or when I’m exploring faith.\nIt’s funny you mention a market gap, because that’s my next question. You think about the classic inventor—say, Eli Whitney and the cotton gin. We can see the market gap there: We don’t want to process this cotton by hand anymore. Here, yes, there’s a market gap in the sense you’re describing: These other LLMs have different values, and maybe their makers present these tools as ethically neutral when really they’re not. So for Gloo, the market gap is for an LLM with biblically informed values.\nBut I want to ask about a market gap in a different sense, which is: What is the lack in the church that this tool is filling? What is it that 2,000 years of Christianity didn’t have that this AI is going to provide?\nYou mean what is AI itself filling as a gap?\n**Yeah, what is the gap in the church?**\nWell, the premise of your question is that we have this timeless gospel message that is complete and sufficient, and we start there. However, what’s also true is that in the world around us, culture constantly moves.\nEven in biblical times, we saw examples of technology. Jesus used the Roman roads. Later on, we had the printing press. When the printing press was first invented, there were plenty of religious leaders decrying that as unnecessary or even evil. So all throughout history, we have examples where initially people of faith are skeptical of a new technology. What happens every time, though, is that culture responds to that new technology and there are new standards or practices that emerge. As Christians, we’re then faced with the question of how we apply this timeless gospel to what’s changed.\nThink of the average congregation: maybe 150 people, a pastor, maybe a youth pastor or secretary. They worship together every Sunday. When you look at that church, what part of that do you see and say, “We need to put AI in there?” Is it the service? Is it the pastoral care? It doesn’t sound like it’s just the scheduling.\nYeah, well, I mean, it doesn’t matter what size church you are. You could be giant, or you could be a hundred people. Like you said, the people in your church are experiencing the most dramatic shift we’ve ever seen in humanity. I mean, AI is affecting them as parents. It’s affecting them in relationships and as workers in jobs. So when our surveys have come back, what we hear is people in churches are interested in their pastors and their leaders helping them navigate this new post-AI world. That’s one thing.\nAnd yes, there are tools that can help with the operational side of church too. It can help us with content repurposing. It can help us with language translation and other administrative tasks.\nBut we also think, as we get deeper into this, that there’s a profound and lasting impact on every life and every church from AI, and the church has an opportunity now to think about how we understand what’s going on and how we equip our people to navigate whatever questions or whatever challenges are coming at them outside the church. The church can be a place where we can come to learn how to navigate a post-AI world.\nI think that’s vital, and pastors should absolutely help us navigate the post-AI world. But what I would want to distinguish here is that there seems to me to be a big difference between one, that guidance, and two, using an AI chatbot to ask personal spiritual questions.\nFor instance, when I emailed with your colleague Chase Cappo, Gloo’s AI enterprise director, he mentioned—and I believe he was talking about KALLM, but correct me if I’m wrong—that there’d already been more than 10 million conversations with Gloo’s Christian AI app. He said that people were “getting more personal than with most pastors.” And I don’t know about you, but I’m a parent, and if I found out my kid was taking personal spiritual questions to a chatbot instead of me or our pastor or another trusted adult human, I would be highly alarmed.\nI think there’s a very big difference between pastors helping Christians navigate a post-AI world and pastors providing Christians with a tool that has no soul so they can talk to it about the state of their spirits, the state of their relationships with God.\nWell, first of all, as a parent, cannot agree more with your sentiment.\nAnd I would also just share we have a core principle at Gloo, and the way we phrase it is that relationships catalyze growth. Our belief is that God has wired each and every one of us to really grow best in the context of relationship, not in the context of interacting with an app or with content or what have you.\nSo when you hear us talk, for example, about values-aligned AI, one of the principles that really drives our work is thinking about how these tools*support*a relationship rather than*replacing*a relationship. And there is a danger of that with the tools we see today. You illustrated one example, where someone might turn to a chat tool in lieu of a person.\nAs we navigate this at Gloo, one of the principles we want to literally design into any tool that supports human flourishing is not just to provide a helpful, productive answer to someone’s question but to point them toward discussing it further, getting into a conversation, making a connection with someone. You’re not going to see most general-market tools behave that way for various reasons. We believe that every tool should support relationship.\n[![Two men carrying a computer window on their shoulders with a golden calf on it.]] \nrelated### [The Silicon Calf] \nA.G. Elrod\n**Practically speaking, would that look like? For instance, certain keywords would prompt the tool to say, “Hey, go talk to your pastor about this”?**\nYeah. Well, in the example that Chase gave you, we have a set of tools called assistants that are placed in various spots. They might be on church websites, or they might be in apps—little chatbots and the like. They’re built with a feature called escalation. We’re learning patterns of when a conversation is appropriate to conduct via chatbot. Like, “What time are the services on Sunday?” “Do you have children’s programming?” Those are fairly administrative, factual questions.\nBut when the conversations get a little bit more sensitive or lose appropriateness for the chatbot, the tool is going to say, “That’s a great question. Let me see if I can connect you to someone at the church who can explain more.” And that then escalates the conversation away from AI to humans. That’s an example of how we support a relationship. We’re not looking keep the conversation in a chatbot forever. We want to eventually make a human connection.\nYou mentioned regular ChatGPT could be damaging to our social, spiritual, or relational health because it*does*have values—and perhaps values we don’t even notice. But if there’s a new technology being used to some negative or at best neutral end, to my mind it doesn’t clearly follow that Christians should just put out the modified “Christian” version of it. There are, I think, some things where we just have to say, “No, that’s not something we’re going to try to redeem.”\nDo you see a line like that coming up in the future of AI as it progresses? Or is this particular technology a case where we*can*do a modified Christian version? I’m not going to hold you to this 50 years down the line, of course, if AI takes an unanticipated swerve. But so far as we can see, is this something we can continue modifying to our purposes?\nI’m tracking with your question. When we use AI as an umbrella term, it refers to such a vast set of technologies and tools and capabilities that we’re really just beginning to understand. So it’s kind of like asking, “Are there guardrails where books should not be used for certain things? Or where the internet should not be used?” I mean, it is quite broad.\nIn that sense, the answer has to be yes. Of course there will be certain applications and uses that, no matter how much you try to redeem it, will destroy human flourishing. They’re going to be antithetical to it. The list would probably be what you’d expect, nefarious or destructive uses around mental health, adult entertainment, and so on.\nBut I think that it would be hard to just outright discard AI or chatbots or any similar category, because each of them can be applied to save lives and find cures for cancer. They can also be applied to negatively affect mental health. The opportunity, I think, and the challenge for us is to distinguish between uses, like between what I cook for dinner and how I parent through a hard situation.\nWe don’t need a modified Christian version to teach me how to cook, but we do need it for matters of ethics, mental health, faith, and so on. That’s the nuance where we’re applying a values-aligned layer over top of the existing tools, not trying to create a replacement for what’s already out there.\n[![Pixel art of a demon with fire bolts flighting a stained glass cross with sparkles.]] \nrelated### [The Bible’s Challenge to Technofans and Technophobes] \n[Andrew Wilson] \n**Having been a new parent relatively recently, I’m very familiar Googling, “How do I get my kid to do X, Y, or Z?” I’m sure you’re right that this is a common way people are using these tools. Is it*inevitable*, though? When people speak about technology—and not just about AI—often they speak in terms of inevitability: “It’s coming. You can’t stop it. You just have to make the best of it.”**\n**And there is some truth to that. Certainly, at the individual level, I have no control. But I question it at the societal scale. I think you see a reconsideration of this kind of thinking with social media, as we’ve belatedly realized its downsides. We*do*have agency, actually. This stuff*isn’t*inevitable, and adapting and redeeming are not the only options.**\nI’m not a pastor, but if I were, I would not want my congregants to inevitably turn to computers for answers to weighty questions about parenting as a Christian. So are we resigned to a future in which people*will*take their problems to computers and all we can do is make sure they take them to computers with our values?\nIt’s so easy to sympathize with a pastor, a parent—anyone who wonders, “Hey, is this a foregone conclusion? Can we not stop the train?”\nAny child growing up today is never going to live in a world that doesn’t have AI. And I think right now, today, in first half of 2025, generally when you’re interacting with these conversational applications or these generative AI tools, you know what you’re doing—that is, I purposefully opened the ChatGPT app on my phone. I know that I’m using it.\nBut I think what we’re going to see as time goes on is that AI will become more and more embedded in more and more things that we do and use every day. It’s going to be in our cars. It’s going to be on our phones. It will be how we consume entertainment, education, what have you.\nMy belief—and, I think, the way Gloo would look at this—is that we see both an opportunity and a responsibility, not just for pastors but for all people of faith. It’s a renewed call for discernment, right?\nI think that maybe an effort to stop young people from using AI tools could be workable for some period of time. But what’s probably more likely and admittedly more nuanced is that we need to teach them how to responsibly use those tools for good.\nWith my own children, we have conversations about what they’re learning, what answers they’re getting back from AI, and how those answers square with what they know to be true. Because we’ve talked about biblical truth. We’ve talked about principles outside what they’re encountering in those tools. There’s an opportunity for pastors, parents, and educators to equip and arm people to have a truth detector and to understand that when you get answers back from AI, you don’t have to accept those outright. You should question and be curious.\nHopefully that kind of discernment is something we’ve always had, but the stakes are higher now with these tools. They speak realistically, and they give us answers that sound right, but that information requires more inspection sometimes.\nI share that hope as well—that we will be able to develop that kind of discernment. I do wonder, though, what it communicates if on the one hand we’re saying, “Hold these tools at an arm’s length. Test what you’re hearing against the truth,” but then on the other hand, when I come to my church’s website, it has an AI chatbot. That’s my church, so why would I doubt it? Isn’t that a confusing message? “Be circumspect about AI and chatbots,” but also “Here’s our chatbot. It’s good.”\nThat’s a great point. And I think you’re really getting to matters, ultimately, of trust. We should be able to trust our religious institutions or houses of faith, and they historically have been a place where trust is held in high esteem. It can also be quickly broken.\nAI tools give churches now a tremendous ability. A small church using AI can create content and repurpose content in forms and languages that would’ve been out of reach only three or five years ago. A small church of 50 people could now have a Spanish-speaking ministry if they chose. That’s a wonderful thing.\nBut to your point, if that church is choosing to use tools that are exposed to the congregation, I would agree there’s a responsibility for the church to know that tool*is*in fact trustworthy and*does*adhere to the values that the church espouses. That does create a higher burden—a higher bar, if you will—for church leaders before they put a tool out there. They need to ensure that’s an invitation to test, to explore, to be curious, to try to break the tool and make sure it’s going to answer the way the pastor would answer. Otherwise, maybe it’s not ready to go out.\n* * [More fromBonnie Kristian] \n* giftGift This Article\n* ## Share\nSharearrow\\_down\n* [facebook\\_grayscaleFacebook] \n* [x\\_grayscaleX] \n* [whatsapp\\_grayscaleWhatsApp] \n* [telegram\\_grayscaleTelegram] \n* [emailEmail] \n* linkCopy Link\n* giftGift Article\n## Related\n[![]] \n### [Blessed Are the Rich, for They Can Afford to Limit Their Kids’ Screen Time] \n[Bonnie Kristian] \n[![]] \n### [Do Not Conform to the Work Habits of AI] \n[Bonnie Kristian] \n[![Children playing at recess]] \n### [The Christian Schools That Cried Wolf] \n[Bonnie Kristian] \n* [Artificial Intelligence (AI)] \n* [Bonnie Kristian] \n* [Church] \n* [Ethics] \n* [Technology] \n* [Worship] \n## Our Latest\n[View All] \n[![People attend the annual March for Life rally on January 23, 2026.]] \nNews\n## [First Year of Trump 2.0 Leaves Pro-lifers with Misgivings] \n[Harvest Prude in Washington] \nAt the March for Life, pro-life Christians express concerns with Washington’s waning commitment to their cause.\n[![U.S. Border Patrol agents smash a man&#039;s car window before dragging him out and taking him into custody when he failed to present citizenship documentation at a gas station on January 11, 2026 in St. Paul, Minnesota.]] \nNews\n## [In a Tense Minnesota, Christians Help Immigrant Neighbors] \n[Emily Belz in Minneapolis] \nAs the Twin Cities reel from ICE arrests and the killing of Alex Pretti, churchgoers drive immigrants to work and doctor’s appointments.\n[![A woman&#039;s forehead with several sharp red triangles pointing at it.]] \n## [My Healing Was God’s Work, Not Mine] \nNatalie Mead\nAfter six years of debilitating chronic migraine disorder, I&#8217;d lost my confidence in the Lord.

He sought divine direction from His Father. He relied on the scriptures and prayer. He lived and taught only those things He learned from His Father,” the handbook says. It adds that Jesus “had a personal and sacred relationship with His Father. He prayed to His Father, learned from Him, and fulfilled His will. Jesus also had meaningful relationships with others. He listened to and talked with them, understood their needs, and ministered to them.”\nThe handbook also offers four principles to guide Latter-day Saints in the appropriate use of AI in their Church assignments.\n* If members use AI, they should do so in positive, helpful, and uplifting ways that uphold the integrity, standards, and teachings of the Church.\n* AI cannot replace the individual work and spiritual guidance required to prepare divinely inspired talks, lessons, prayers, or blessings. However, AI can be helpful for research, editing, translation, and similar tasks.\n* Leaders should not rely upon AI to provide advice to members on medical, financial, legal, or other sensitive matters. If members need assistance beyond the spiritual guidance provided by Church leaders, competent professionals may be helpful.\n* Sensitive information, such as Church records, personal member data, or confidential communications, should not be entered into AI tools that are not provided or managed by the Church.\nIn addition to this handbook update, Church leaders have taught the same principles about AI on several occasions over the past two years.\nFor example, in January 2024, Elder David A. Bednar told Brigham Young University (BYU) students that AI can be either good or bad, depending on how it is used. He encouraged them to[use AI in ways that will strengthen their moral agency].\n## [![] BYU Speeches“Consider the Wondrous Works of God” (Job 37:14)] \n“Please do not allow the supposed accuracy, speed, and ease of modern technologies to entice you to avoid or circumvent the righteous work that invites into your life the blessings you will need,” he said. “My beloved brothers and sisters, there are no spiritual shortcuts or quick fixes.”\n## [![] Worldwide DevotionalThings as They Really Are 2.0] \nIn a follow-up to that speech a few months later,[Elder Bednar invited] Latter-day Saints to do two important things: “humbly and prayerfully (1) identify gospel principles that can guide their use of artificial intelligence and (2) strive sincerely for the companionship of the Holy Ghost and the spiritual gift of revelation.”\nThis is critical because, as Elder Bednar also taught, technological advancements such as AI “are part of the Lord hastening His work in the latter days.”\n## [![] NewsroomGuiding Principles for the Church’s Use of Artificial Intelligence] \nFellow Apostle Elder Gerrit W. Gong has also given several speeches focused on AI. In a March 2024 address, he introduced[guiding principles on the use of AI] to Church employees. And speaking at BYU in August 2025, he taught that seeking the wisdom and understanding of God should be our highest priority. Like Elder Bednar, he said AI should support —not supplant —our connection with Deity.\n## [![] BYU SpeechesAn Ear to Wisdom, a Heart to Understanding] \n“Artificial intelligence is not God and cannot be God,”[Elder Gong said]. “We can consciously choose and intentionally use AI as a tool for good [and] ... we can invite leaders and citizens across industry, research, civic and government bodies, and faith leaders to align rapid AI developments and enduring faith-based principles and moral values.”\nElder Gong emphasized that God will bless us with wisdom and understanding as we “intentionally desire and diligently seek wisdom and understanding.”\n“Artificial intelligence cannot replace revelation or generate truth from God,” he said. “We have the responsibility to ensure the Holy Ghost can attest to the truth and authenticity of all we say and share —in our form and in our content.”\n## [![] Europe NewsroomApostle Invites Faith and Ethics Evaluation of Artificial Intelligence Models] \nAt a Vatican City summit of faith, thought and technology leaders on AI ethics in October 2025, Elder Gong reaffirmed the need for a[Faith and Ethics AI Evaluation] for artificial intelligence models.\n“Portraying faith traditions accurately and respectfully is not an imposition of religion on AI. Rather, it is a public necessity,” Elder Gong said. “It is especially needed as increasing numbers of individuals ask AI about faith and belief, and as AI becomes a primary source of information about faith traditions.”\nLatter-day Saints are encouraged to review Church leaders’ teachings on artificial intelligence and “General Handbook” section 38.8.47, “Appropriate Use of Artificial Intelligence.”\n## Additional Resources\n* [Handbook: Appropriate Use of Artificial Intelligence] \n* [The Latest Updates to the ‘General Handbook’: December 2025] \n* [\n] \n* [\n] \n* [\n] \n* [\n] \n* Copied to Clipboard\n* [] \nClick toviewhidethe Infographic\n[] [] [] [&lt; &gt;\\ \\ \\ \\ Code Copied] [] \nI agree to the Terms of Use for Media File Use.\n![] \n![] \n[Previous ArticleThe Latest Updates to the ‘General Handbook’: December 2025] [Next ArticleNew Guidance on Bible Translations for Latter-day Saints] \n**Style Guide Note:**When reporting about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, please use the complete name of the Church in the first reference.
