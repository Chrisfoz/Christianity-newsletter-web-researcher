In this issue, you’ll read about how a monastery on Patmos offers quiet in a world of noise and, from Ann Voskamp, how God’s will is a place to find home. Read about modern missions terminology in our roundtable feature and about an astrophysicist’s thoughts on the Incarnation. Be sure to linger over Andy Olsen’s reported feature “An American Deportation” as we consider Christian responses to immigration policies. May we practice hospitality wherever we find ourselves.\n\nNovember/December 2025\n\n[View current issue](https://www.christianitytoday.com/magazine/2025/november-december/)\n\n[**The Incarnation Sheds Light on Astrophysics**](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/11/the-incarnation-sheds-light-on-astrophysics/)\n\nDeborah Haarsma\n\n[**The Architecture of Revelation**](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/11/the-architecture-of-revelation/)\n\nKyle Dugdale\n\n[**Charity Begins with Zoning Reforms**](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/11/hospitality-begins-with-zoning-reforms/)\n\nMark D.

Gather25 will be a 25-hour event hosted both virtually and in person across six continents.\n\nAI translation technology will allow live music, teaching, prayers, and international stories of hope to be shared globally at the same time. Christians can join from their homes, theatres, local churches, or at one of the live broadcast sites.\n\nThe event is being supported by organisations such as YouVersion, The Bible Project, illumiNations and 24-7 Prayer International.\n\nJennie Allen, founder and visionary behind Gather25, said: \"For the first time in history, the entire Church is actually able to gather. We are inviting all 2.5 billion people who love Jesus to come together to pray, to see stories of the Church, and to commission them to become missionaries wherever they are to reach the ends of the earth.\"\n\nAllen told _Premier_ she was inspired to start the project after having a vision of the second coming: \"It was so vivid. I woke up and thought 'What would we do if he was coming back soon?' We'd bring everyone together across the world, and we would be on the same mission, the way that Jesus told us to be.\"\n\nDr Charles Mugisha is the co-founder of Africa New Life Ministries and lead pastor of New Life Bible Church Rwanda. He said: \"Gather25 is an opportunity for God's people to become one, with Christ at the centre.\n\n\"There are billions of people and many people groups, who don't know the love of God – my prayer is that Gather25 would ignite a new commissioning of the Church under the power of the Holy Spirit so that every soul would be reached with the love of God.\"\n\nThe event will take place on 1st March 2025.\n\n### A Monthly Gift Of $11 Makes A World Of Difference\n\nIn a world of fake news there’s never been a greater need for quality Christian journalism.

AI algorithms pieced together, elaborated and completed the data.\n\nDrones flew at night for 4 weeks, taking over 400,000 photographs and collecting the equivalent of a 6 km-high column of DVDs in data. Data from the digital twin will also be instrumental in preservation and restoration work.\n\n\"We are taking St. Peter's not just to the world but to a new generation of people, in a language that is more accessible for the times we live in,\" Microsoft President Brad Smith told reporters.\n\nPope Francis has acknowledged that AI can broaden access to knowledge but has repeatedly warned that it must only be used in an ethical way, to benefit humanity.\n\n\"The correct and constructive use of (AI's) potential, which is certainly useful but can be ambivalent, depends on us,\" he said on Monday when the project was presented to him.\n\n### A Monthly Gift Of $11 Makes A World Of Difference\n\nIn a world of fake news there’s never been a greater need for quality Christian journalism.
