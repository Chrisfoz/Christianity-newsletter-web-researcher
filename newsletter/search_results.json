Photo: Wikimedia Commons\n\nA new digital awakening is unfolding in churches, where pastors and prayer apps are turning to [artificial intelligence](https://www.axios.com/technology/automation-and-ai) to reach worshippers, personalize sermons, and power chatbots that resemble God.\n\n**Why it matters:** AI is helping some churches stay relevant in the face of shrinking staff, empty pews and growing online audiences. But the practice raises new questions about who, or what, is guiding the flock.\n\n- New AI-powered apps allow you to \"text with Jesus\" or \"talk to the Bible,\" giving the impression you are communicating with a deity or angel.\n- Other apps can create personalized prayers, let you confess your sins or offer religious advice on life's decisions.\n- \"What could go wrong?\" Robert P. Jones, CEO of the nonpartisan [Public Religion Research Institute](https://ava.prri.org/#religious/2022/States/religion/m/national), sarcastically asks.\n\n**State of play:** The U.S. could see an unprecedented [15,000 churches](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/03/us-churches-close-religious-shift-christians) shut their doors this year as a [record number of Americans (29%)](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/26/us-christianity-decline-pew-study) now are identifying as religiously unaffiliated.\n\n- Megachurches are consolidating the remaining faithful, but even the most charismatic pastors struggle to offer private counseling with such large congregations.\n\n**Zoom in:** In recent months, churches have been deploying chatbots to answer frequently asked questions such as service times and event details, and even to share scripture.\n\n- [EpiscoBot](https://www.episcobot.com/), a chatbot developed by the [TryTank Research Institute](https://www.facebook.com/trytank/posts/were-thrilled-to-announce-the-launch-of-episcobot-the-next-generation-version-of/1275693494560722/) for the Episcopal Church, responds to spiritual or faith-related queries, drawing on church resources.\n- Other AI apps analyze [congregational data](https://magai.co/ai-for-churches-everything-you-need-to-know/) (attendance and engagement) to tailor outreach and communications.\n- And more [pastors](https://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/austin-church-holds-ai-generated-service-uses-chatgpt/) are admitting that they use AI to assist in [creating sermons](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/2025-07-17/we-asked-clergy-if-they-use-ai-to-help-write-sermons-heres-what-they-said) or reduce writing time.\n\n**What they're saying: \"** Every church or house of worship is a business. There are absolutely opportunities to generate AI bots to evangelize,\" Rev. Chris Hope, founder of the [Boston-based Hope Group](https://www.hopecoded.com/), tells Axios.\n\n- Hope's consulting firm helps churches and minority-owned businesses use \"ethical\" AI.\n- \"AI can help with greater scheduling, coordination of preaching engagements and missions work. We haven't tapped the surface with how we could integrate these technologies to advance the word of God.\"\n\n**Yes, but:** The AI uses getting the most attention (and scrutiny) are those that create the feeling that users are talking to a [divine power](https://www.askjesuschatbot.com/) or clergy.\n\n- The [Text With Jesus app](https://textwith.me/en/jesus/) allows users to \"embark on a spiritual journey and engage in enlightening conversations with Jesus Christ,\" according to the app's website.\n\n- The app also gives users the option to \"talk\" with other Biblical characters, including Mary, Joseph, Judas Iscariot, and even [Satan](https://textwith.me/en/jesus/#:~:text=Satan%20is%20included%20in%20the%20app%20to).\n- Catholic apps [One Day Confess](https://apps.apple.com/me/app/one-day-confession/id6612038754) and [Confession - Catholic](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/confession-catholic/id6642659527) help users with confession and spiritual reflection, providing AI-guided responses based on biblical texts.\n\n**San Jose, California-based megachurch** pastor [Ron Carpenter](https://roncarpenter.com/) has even created an [AI app](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/ron-carpenter-ai/id6737125441) promising [\"1-on-1 personalized interactions\"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.roncarpenter.innovatixclone&hl=en_US) with a bot version of him for $49 per month.\n\n- Rev. Louis Attles, who guides [La Mott A.M.E. Church](https://lamottame.org/our-pastor), a small parish in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, tells Axios he also created a chatbot named \"Faith\" that helps him conduct research for his sermons.\n- \"You can't outsource your morality,\" Attles said. \"It cannot keep a covenant for you.\"\n\n**Between the lines:** It's unclear what translations of the Bible the apps are using, if they are texts from early church fathers or ideological materials from strictly conservative groups, Jones said.\n\n- Mark Graves, research director at [AI and Faith](https://aiandfaith.org/), a nonprofit focused on engaging religions with AI, tells Axios that the apps are in their early phases and are likely using publicly available material for their datasets.\n- \"I think the incentives are to get it out quickly and just see what happens. The risks are very high,\" Graves said.\n\n- facebook (opens in new window)\n\n- twitter (opens in new window)\n\n- linkedin (opens in new window)\n\n- email (opens in new window)\n\n\n[Add Axios on Google](https://google.com/preferences/source?q=axios.com)\n\n##### What to read next"

The 39-page document outlines a list of general principles that Christian leaders should consider when interacting with AI, as well as several scenarios that churches may encounter as the prevalence of AI technology increases.\n\nThe document condemns any efforts to use AI to \"seek to short-circuit or cut short the process of maturation and development of wisdom.\" It warns against the use of \"AI-drafted sermons,\" asserting that \"AI can assist the pastor in preparation, but it should never be used to replace or substitute for the distinct calling upon the man of God to preach God's Word to God's people.\"\n\n\"The process of sermon development is one of the ways that God refreshes and refines the heart of the preacher,\" the guide reads. \"If it is short-circuited, valuable and personal engagement with the text is lost. As a general rule, these tools are best to use once one has done the hard work of exegesis and research, a process which must be bathed in prayer and personal reflection.\"\n\nThe document's goal is to \"equip pastors and ministry leaders as they seek to shepherd their people amid these pressing issues, ranging from the family and education to business and ministry,\" ERLC Senior Fellow Jason Thacker said in a statement.\n\n\"As we know, we can no longer keep the issues surrounding the ethical use of AI at arm's length,\" said Thacker. \"These issues now affect all of us in profound ways as technology continues to shape every aspect of our lives — both for good and ill.\"\n\nRaShan Frost, ERLC director of research and senior fellow, stressed that \"technological advances are outpacing our understanding of them and at times how we think about the moral and ethical implications of arriving technologies.\"\n\n\"Thankfully, God's Word provides us with timeless insights, commands and principles to draw from to guide us in all aspects of life and faith,\" Frost said.\n\nThe guide helps \"take God's Word, and from it draw out theological and ethical principles to help us navigate a world with artificial intelligence\" and \"take those principles and think through practical scenarios that pastors, lay leaders, staff members, and congregants may experience,\" Frost continued.\n\nRegarding the prospect of church leaders employing AI assistants, the guide advises against the use of AI in a way that ends up \"replacing key aspects of another person's ministry,\" once again maintaining that the technology should only be used as a supplement.\n\n\"We must never seek to employ AI and other emerging technologies in ways that diminish the dignity of any human being by using AI as a means to subvert the human calling as image bearers of God to shape the world around them,\" the document declares. \"AI must only be used in ways that complement \\[the\\] holistic transformation\" that results from the \"godly\" development of \"the whole person, including our minds, bodies, and hearts.\"\n\nAdditionally, the guide warns that AI \"should never be a substitute for or replacement for a rich embodied community, ultimately with God and with other human beings.\"\n\n\"Any faithful approach to AI and emerging technologies must be rooted in the transcendent nature of God and his sovereign control over all things, including even the most advanced AI systems,\" the guide states.\n\nThe document stresses that technologies, including AI, \"must only be developed, deployed, evaluated, and used in ways that champion the immeasurable dignity of all people.\"\n\nAs the world debates how to respond to the rapid development of AI technology, The Christian Post, Colorado Christian University and Gloo will co-host a summit on Oct. 7 titled \" [AI For Humanity: Navigating Ethics and Morality for a Flourishing Future](https://www.christianpost.com/news/the-christian-post-ccu-gloo-to-host-summit-on-ai-and-faith.html).\"\n\nThe event, which will take place at Colorado Christian University in Lakewood, Colorado, will feature \"keynote addresses, panel discussions and interactive sessions designed to equip Christian higher education institutions, students and tech innovators with strategies to responsibly integrate AI within a faith-informed framework.\"\n\nRyan Foley is a reporter for The Christian Post.

(OSV News illustration/Dado Ruvic, Reuters)\nVATICAN CITY (CNS) -- \"Technological progress is part of God's plan for creation,\" the Vatican said, but people must take responsibility for using technologies like artificial intelligence to help humanity and not harm individuals or groups.\n\"Like any tool, AI is an extension of human power, and while its future capabilities are unpredictable, humanity's past actions provide clear warnings,\" said the document signed by Cardinals Víctor Manuel Fernández, prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, and José Tolentino de Mendonça, prefect of the Dicastery for Culture and Education.\nThe document, approved by Pope Francis Jan. 14 and released by the Vatican Jan. 28 -- the day after International Holocaust Remembrance Day -- said \"the atrocities committed throughout history are enough to raise deep concerns about the potential abuses of AI.\"\nTitled,[\"Antiqua et Nova (ancient and new): Note on the Relationship Between Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence,\"](https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_ddf_doc_20250128_antiqua-et-nova_en.html)the document focused particularly on the moral use of technology and on the impact artificial intelligence already is having or could have on interpersonal relationships, education, work, art, health care, law, warfare and international relations.\nAI technology is used not only in apps like ChatGPT and search engines, but in advertising, self-driving cars, autonomous weapons systems, security and surveillance systems, factory robotics and data analysis, including in health care.\n![Pope Francis speaks about AI at a G7 meeting](https://www.usccb.org/sites/default/files/2025-01/20240614T1100-POPE-G7-AI-1778245.JPG)Pope Francis gives a speech on the benefits and dangers of artifical intelligence to world leaders attending the Group of Seven summit in Borgo Egnazia in Italy's southern Puglia region, June 14, 2024. (CNS photo/Vatican Media)\nThe popes and Vatican institutions, particularly the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, have been monitoring and raising concerns about the development and use of artificial intelligence for more than 40 years.\n\"Like any product of human creativity, AI can be directed toward positive or negative ends,\" the Vatican document said. \"When used in ways that respect human dignity and promote the well-being of individuals and communities, it can contribute positively to the human vocation.\"\n\"Yet, as in all areas where humans are called to make decisions, the shadow of evil also looms here,\" the dicasteries said. \"Where human freedom allows for the possibility of choosing what is wrong, the moral evaluation of this technology will need to take into account how it is directed and used.\"\nHuman beings, not machines, make moral decisions, the document said. So, \"it is important that ultimate responsibility for decisions made using AI rests with the human decision-makers and that there is accountability for the use of AI at each stage of the decision-making process.\"\nThe Vatican document insisted that while artificial intelligence can quickly perform some very complex tasks or access vast amounts of information, it is not truly intelligent, at least not in the same way human beings are.\n![Cardinal Tolentino de Mendonca at a news conference](https://www.usccb.org/sites/default/files/2025-01/20250128T0630-FILE-CARDINAL-TOLENTINO-MENDONCA-1789111.JPG)Cardinal José Tolentino de Mendonça, prefect of the Dicastery for Culture and Education, speaks at a Vatican news conference in this file photo from Oct. 17, 2023. (CNS photo/Lola Gomez)\n\"A proper understanding of human intelligence,\" it said, \"cannot be reduced to the mere acquisition of facts or the ability to perform specific tasks. Instead, it involves the person's openness to the ultimate questions of life and reflects an orientation toward the true and the good.\"\nHuman intelligence also involves listening to others, empathizing with them, forming relationships and making moral judgments -- actions which even the most sophisticated AI programs cannot do, it said.\n\"Between a machine and a human, only the human can be sufficiently self-aware to the point of listening and following the voice of conscience, discerning with prudence, and seeking the good that is possible in every situation,\" the document said.\nThe Vatican dicasteries issued several warnings or cautions in the document, calling on individual users, developers and even governments to exercise control over how AI is used and to commit \"to ensuring that AI always supports and promotes the supreme value of the dignity of every human being and the fullness of the human vocation.\"\n![Cardinal Fernandez speaks at a Vatican news conference](https://www.usccb.org/sites/default/files/2025-01/20250128T0630-FILE-CARDINAL-FERNANDEZ-1789110.JPG)Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, speaks to reporters at the Vatican in this file photo from Sept. 19, 2024. (CNS photo/Justin McLellan)\nFirst, they said, \"misrepresenting AI as a person should always be avoided; doing so for fraudulent purposes is a grave ethical violation that could erode social trust. Similarly, using AI to deceive in other contexts -- such as in education or in human relationships, including the sphere of sexuality -- is also to be considered immoral and requires careful oversight to prevent harm, maintain transparency, and ensure the dignity of all people.\"\nThe dicasteries warned that \"AI could be used to perpetuate marginalization and discrimination, create new forms of poverty, widen the 'digital divide,' and worsen existing social inequalities.\"\nWhile AI promises to boost productivity in the workplace \"by taking over mundane tasks,\" the document said, \"it frequently forces workers to adapt to the speed and demands of machines rather than machines being designed to support those who work.\"\nParents, teachers and students also need to be careful with their reliance on AI, it said, and they need to know its limits.\n\"The extensive use of AI in education could lead to the students' increased reliance on technology, eroding their ability to perform some skills independently and worsening their dependence on screens,\" it said.\nAnd while AI may provide information, the document said, it does not actually educate, which requires thinking, reasoning and discerning.\n![The ChatGPT app on a phone](https://www.usccb.org/sites/default/files/2025-01/20240308T1115-BENANTI-ALGORITHMS-1773599.JPG)The ChatGPT app is seen on a phone placed atop a keyboard in this photo taken in Rome March 8, 2024. (CNS photo/Lola Gomez)\nUsers must also be aware of AI's \"serious risk of generating manipulated content and false information, which can easily mislead people due to its resemblance to the truth. Such misinformation might occur unintentionally, as in the case of AI 'hallucination,' where a generative AI system yields results that appear real but are not\" because it is programmed to respond to every request for information, regardless of whether it has access to it.\nOf course, the document said, AI's falsehood also \"can be intentional: individuals or organizations intentionally generate and spread false content with the aim to deceive or cause harm, such as 'deepfake' images, videos and audio -- referring to a false depiction of a person, edited or generated by an AI algorithm.\"\nMilitary applications of AI technology are particularly worrisome, the document said, because of \"the ease with which autonomous weapons make war more viable,\" AI's potential for removing \"human oversight\" from weapons deployment and the possibility that autonomous weapons will become the object of a new \"destabilizing arms race, with catastrophic consequences for human rights.\n## CATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE\nWith its Rome bureau founded in 1950, Catholic News Service has been providing complete, in-depth coverage of the popes and the Vatican for more than 70 years.

ChatGPT, the most famous of large language models (LLMs)—programs that can function as chatbots, create content, and perform administrative tasks based on conversational instructions from users—launched in late 2022. Since then, LLMs have rapidly progressed in their capabilities and are increasingly integrated into our digital lives.\nBut should they be[integrated into](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2023/07/ai-chatgpt-exegetical-tool-bible-scripture-sermon-mount/)our*spiritual*lives? Should[pastors use](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2023/09/ai-has-no-place-in-pulpit-chatgpt-llm-openai-preaching-past/)LLMs to[write sermons](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2023/09/chatgpt-ai-ministry-pastoral-taiwan/)or[reformat sermon content](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJA0gamhkOR/)into small-group study guides? Should church websites have chatbots on hand to answer visitors’ questions around the clock? Is there a role for AI in[discipleship and catechesis](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2023/01/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-ai-preach-sermons-church/)?\nMy own answer (others at CT may hold different views) to all those questions is*no.*While I do see some practical uses for AI—like transcribing the dialogue below, with a backstop of full human review—I’m deeply wary of proposals to bring LLMs and similar AI tools into the life of the church. I believe that chatbots have no place in spiritual formation or pastoral care and that even many simpler applications, like telling a potential visitor when the Sunday service starts, are already amply handled by regular old websites.\n## Sign up for The Daily Briefing\nGet the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily.\nEmail\\*Sign Up\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google[Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)and[Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms)apply.\nThanks for signing up.\nExplore[more newsletters](https://www.christianitytoday.com/newsletters/?utm_source=ct-newsletter&#038;utm_medium=confirmation-offer&#038;utm_campaign=newsletterpromo)—don&#8217;t forget to start your[free 60-day trial of CT](https://www.christianitytoday.com/membership/trial/?utm_content=60-day-trial&#038;utm_source=ct-newsletter&#038;utm_medium=confirmation-offer&#038;utm_campaign=60-day-trial)to get full access to all articles in every newsletter.\nSorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\nThose instincts made me curious about Gloo, a dominant player in the “Christian AI” space. The Colorado-based company brands itself as “the leading technology platform dedicated to connecting the faith ecosystem,”[and last summer](https://religionnews.com/2024/07/31/gloo-secures-110-million-strategic-growth-investment/)it announced $110 million in new venture capital funding.\n[Gloo promises](https://gloo.com/ai/products/chat)“AI you can trust for life’s biggest questions,” a chatbot that “guides you to real answers and next steps for a life that matters.” An animation on its site suggests that users ask the chatbot “anything” about the Bible, politics, religion, relationships, and more.\nGloo offers “verified” answers from “reliable sources” that are “biblically sound” and “grounded in faith-based principles” so it can “guide you and those you care about with confidence.” But equally—[on the same page, in the same list](https://gloo.com/ai/products/chat)—the company offers personalization so individual users can get answers that reflect what they already believe.\n“Customize your experience with filters that align with your values, ensuring every result reflects what matters most to you,” the site says next to an illustration apparently suggesting users can reject an information source for their personal AI interface.\nThis language left me wondering what it means to make[what Gloo calls](https://gloo.com/ai)“values-aligned” AI. The company first connected me to its chief AI officer, Steele Billings. Our conversation centered on the technology, and Billings explained that Gloo uses Microsoft’s[Responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai), then layers its own standards and training data from Christian sources on top.\nThat starts with Harvard’s[Global Flourishing Study](https://hfh.fas.harvard.edu/global-flourishing-study), which[defines human flourishing](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/global-flourishing-study-good-life/)in[six dimensions](https://hfh.fas.harvard.edu/measuring-flourishing): “happiness and life satisfaction, physical and mental health, meaning and purpose, character and virtue,” “close social relationships,” and “financial and material stability.” To that list, with help from evangelical polling firm the Barna Group, Billings told me, Gloo added a seventh dimension of faith and spirituality.\n[![Three ovals containing hands holding glowing points of light on an orange background.](https://www.christianitytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/measuring_the_good_life-1.jpg?w=162&amp;h=88&amp;crop=1)](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/global-flourishing-study-good-life/)\nrelated### [Measuring the Good Life](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/global-flourishing-study-good-life/)\nBrendan Case, Katelyn N. G. Long, Tyler J. VanderWeele, and Byron R. Johnson\nOf course, people of faith are famously prone to disagreement about the truth—thus the personalization. Gloo tools can be customized by individual, congregational and denominational users, Billings said: “One of the things that our technology does is it will go out when a church signs up” and “pull the statement of faith off the church website” so it can “answer questions that are aligned with that statement of faith.”\nThat customization even extends outside the church, Billings confirmed when I asked about other religions, like Judaism or Islam. “While today you would see mostly Protestant organizations on our platform,” he told me, “we do not prohibit in any way a Muslim organization from coming in and using our technology.”\nLater this spring, I also spoke with Brad Hill, Gloo’s chief solutions officer. That conversation, which turned from the technical details to Gloo’s philosophy of AI development and function, is below. It has been edited and condensed.\nEditor’s note: Christianity Today has partnered with Gloo on advertising projects in the past, including the development of branded content about[AI and the church](https://www.christianitytoday.com/partners/gloo/ai-and-the-church/). These projects have never involved CT’s editorial team and had no influence on this article.\nI’d like to focus here on some higher-level questions about the purpose, goals, and visions that Gloo has for the Kingdom-Aligned Large Language Model (KALLM) and for your work with churches in particular. Let’s start with something your colleague, Steele Billings, said when we spoke about the technical side of this work: “Technology is neutral,” and it’s about what we choose to do with it, what kind of worldview we bring to that task, whether it’s a biblical worldview. Is that Gloo’s mindset? If yes, what does that look like? How do you think about it?\nThat’s a great starting point. Yes, that is what we would contend: The technology is neutral.\nPut another way, I’ve heard it described as amoral. It’s neither good nor bad. It can certainly be applied for things that are quite bad, but also it can be applied for things that are incredibly good and incredibly redemptive.\nOur contention is that in every other station of culture, wherever we look in the world, technology is being used. And our strong belief is that the church—and those in ministry and, as we would say, the faith and flourishing ecosystem—needs to be equipped with the very same tools for good. It’s important. It&#8217;s not a “nice to have” anymore.\nOne reason is that technology is more than just tools, bits and bytes. It’s shaping culture. Look at what happened with social media over the last decade plus. Look at the internet and how it’s affected every station of life. AI is now a very similar phenomenon that’s upon us. So while the technology itself might be classified as neutral, we would contend strongly that people who are in the business of flourishing and people who are trying to advance good need to be equipped with the very best tech so that they can apply it to that end.\n[![](https://www.christianitytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/136165.jpg?w=162&amp;h=88&amp;crop=1)](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2023/09/artificial-intelligence-robots-soul-formation/)\nrecommended### [AI Will Shape Your Soul](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2023/09/artificial-intelligence-robots-soul-formation/)\n[Kate Lucky](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/kate-lucky/)\nIf I can probe that a little bit, I think there are many uses of AI that are pretty uncontroversial: people who use it as a search engine, for example, or administrative functions like scheduling meetings. Where it tends to be controversial, as you no doubt know, is around creating material—for instance, writing sermons or study guides based on sermons. And so that affirmation that the technology is neutral, is that truly across-the-board for Gloo? Or are there areas that you would say are off-limits?\nIt’s an interesting question, and I think honestly there are different answers to that question depending on whether you have AI tools that are built with a values alignment or not.\nWe don’t say technology is neutral if we’re dealing with tools that just have a general-market use, which is mostly what the public is familiar with right now. Even your example that was somewhat innocuous—of using ChatGPT as a search engine—I would contend that’s*not*neutral, because most folks may not fully understand where ChatGPT is getting its results, and those results are likely not aligned to the values of someone who follows Christianity or adheres to biblical truth. If you ask questions on matters of ethics and deeply felt needs, you may get answers that are antithetical to Scripture.\nHowever, when you have tools that are built on more of a biblical foundation and aligned to human flourishing values, I would say my answer broadens regarding what’s within bounds. Because then you feel a lot more confident turning to these tools to answer questions around some of those weightier issues. That’s exactly what we see at Gloo.\nRight now, there’s a gap in the market for generative AI tools that are trained on the values we hold. So for instance, I could ask ChatGPT to help me plan dinner. I think ChatGPT is a wonderful tool for that or for scheduling, as you said. But when we’re asking these weightier questions around faith, ethics, and morality, we want tools built on a model that’s been trained on proper values.\nAnd that’s what Gloo is building now. We’re ultimately not looking to fully*replace*tools like ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini but to*complement*them and leverage the good that’s in all of them so that we have an incredible tool that can tell me what to make for dinner*and*can help me as a parent or in a relationship or when I’m exploring faith.\nIt’s funny you mention a market gap, because that’s my next question. You think about the classic inventor—say, Eli Whitney and the cotton gin. We can see the market gap there: We don’t want to process this cotton by hand anymore. Here, yes, there’s a market gap in the sense you’re describing: These other LLMs have different values, and maybe their makers present these tools as ethically neutral when really they’re not. So for Gloo, the market gap is for an LLM with biblically informed values.\nBut I want to ask about a market gap in a different sense, which is: What is the lack in the church that this tool is filling? What is it that 2,000 years of Christianity didn’t have that this AI is going to provide?\nYou mean what is AI itself filling as a gap?\n**Yeah, what is the gap in the church?**\nWell, the premise of your question is that we have this timeless gospel message that is complete and sufficient, and we start there. However, what’s also true is that in the world around us, culture constantly moves.\nEven in biblical times, we saw examples of technology. Jesus used the Roman roads. Later on, we had the printing press. When the printing press was first invented, there were plenty of religious leaders decrying that as unnecessary or even evil. So all throughout history, we have examples where initially people of faith are skeptical of a new technology. What happens every time, though, is that culture responds to that new technology and there are new standards or practices that emerge. As Christians, we’re then faced with the question of how we apply this timeless gospel to what’s changed.\nThink of the average congregation: maybe 150 people, a pastor, maybe a youth pastor or secretary. They worship together every Sunday. When you look at that church, what part of that do you see and say, “We need to put AI in there?” Is it the service? Is it the pastoral care? It doesn’t sound like it’s just the scheduling.\nYeah, well, I mean, it doesn’t matter what size church you are. You could be giant, or you could be a hundred people. Like you said, the people in your church are experiencing the most dramatic shift we’ve ever seen in humanity. I mean, AI is affecting them as parents. It’s affecting them in relationships and as workers in jobs. So when our surveys have come back, what we hear is people in churches are interested in their pastors and their leaders helping them navigate this new post-AI world. That’s one thing.\nAnd yes, there are tools that can help with the operational side of church too. It can help us with content repurposing. It can help us with language translation and other administrative tasks.\nBut we also think, as we get deeper into this, that there’s a profound and lasting impact on every life and every church from AI, and the church has an opportunity now to think about how we understand what’s going on and how we equip our people to navigate whatever questions or whatever challenges are coming at them outside the church. The church can be a place where we can come to learn how to navigate a post-AI world.\nI think that’s vital, and pastors should absolutely help us navigate the post-AI world. But what I would want to distinguish here is that there seems to me to be a big difference between one, that guidance, and two, using an AI chatbot to ask personal spiritual questions.\nFor instance, when I emailed with your colleague Chase Cappo, Gloo’s AI enterprise director, he mentioned—and I believe he was talking about KALLM, but correct me if I’m wrong—that there’d already been more than 10 million conversations with Gloo’s Christian AI app. He said that people were “getting more personal than with most pastors.” And I don’t know about you, but I’m a parent, and if I found out my kid was taking personal spiritual questions to a chatbot instead of me or our pastor or another trusted adult human, I would be highly alarmed.\nI think there’s a very big difference between pastors helping Christians navigate a post-AI world and pastors providing Christians with a tool that has no soul so they can talk to it about the state of their spirits, the state of their relationships with God.\nWell, first of all, as a parent, cannot agree more with your sentiment.\nAnd I would also just share we have a core principle at Gloo, and the way we phrase it is that relationships catalyze growth. Our belief is that God has wired each and every one of us to really grow best in the context of relationship, not in the context of interacting with an app or with content or what have you.\nSo when you hear us talk, for example, about values-aligned AI, one of the principles that really drives our work is thinking about how these tools*support*a relationship rather than*replacing*a relationship. And there is a danger of that with the tools we see today. You illustrated one example, where someone might turn to a chat tool in lieu of a person.\nAs we navigate this at Gloo, one of the principles we want to literally design into any tool that supports human flourishing is not just to provide a helpful, productive answer to someone’s question but to point them toward discussing it further, getting into a conversation, making a connection with someone. You’re not going to see most general-market tools behave that way for various reasons. We believe that every tool should support relationship.\n[![Two men carrying a computer window on their shoulders with a golden calf on it.](https://www.christianitytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/the-silicon-calf.jpg?w=162&amp;h=88&amp;crop=1)](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/04/the-silicon-calf-artificial-general-intelligence-idolatry-faith/)\nrelated### [The Silicon Calf](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/04/the-silicon-calf-artificial-general-intelligence-idolatry-faith/)\nA.G. Elrod\n**Practically speaking, would that look like? For instance, certain keywords would prompt the tool to say, “Hey, go talk to your pastor about this”?**\nYeah. Well, in the example that Chase gave you, we have a set of tools called assistants that are placed in various spots. They might be on church websites, or they might be in apps—little chatbots and the like. They’re built with a feature called escalation. We’re learning patterns of when a conversation is appropriate to conduct via chatbot. Like, “What time are the services on Sunday?” “Do you have children’s programming?” Those are fairly administrative, factual questions.\nBut when the conversations get a little bit more sensitive or lose appropriateness for the chatbot, the tool is going to say, “That’s a great question. Let me see if I can connect you to someone at the church who can explain more.” And that then escalates the conversation away from AI to humans. That’s an example of how we support a relationship. We’re not looking keep the conversation in a chatbot forever. We want to eventually make a human connection.\nYou mentioned regular ChatGPT could be damaging to our social, spiritual, or relational health because it*does*have values—and perhaps values we don’t even notice. But if there’s a new technology being used to some negative or at best neutral end, to my mind it doesn’t clearly follow that Christians should just put out the modified “Christian” version of it. There are, I think, some things where we just have to say, “No, that’s not something we’re going to try to redeem.”\nDo you see a line like that coming up in the future of AI as it progresses? Or is this particular technology a case where we*can*do a modified Christian version? I’m not going to hold you to this 50 years down the line, of course, if AI takes an unanticipated swerve. But so far as we can see, is this something we can continue modifying to our purposes?\nI’m tracking with your question. When we use AI as an umbrella term, it refers to such a vast set of technologies and tools and capabilities that we’re really just beginning to understand. So it’s kind of like asking, “Are there guardrails where books should not be used for certain things? Or where the internet should not be used?” I mean, it is quite broad.\nIn that sense, the answer has to be yes. Of course there will be certain applications and uses that, no matter how much you try to redeem it, will destroy human flourishing. They’re going to be antithetical to it. The list would probably be what you’d expect, nefarious or destructive uses around mental health, adult entertainment, and so on.\nBut I think that it would be hard to just outright discard AI or chatbots or any similar category, because each of them can be applied to save lives and find cures for cancer. They can also be applied to negatively affect mental health. The opportunity, I think, and the challenge for us is to distinguish between uses, like between what I cook for dinner and how I parent through a hard situation.\nWe don’t need a modified Christian version to teach me how to cook, but we do need it for matters of ethics, mental health, faith, and so on. That’s the nuance where we’re applying a values-aligned layer over top of the existing tools, not trying to create a replacement for what’s already out there.\n[![Pixel art of a demon with fire bolts flighting a stained glass cross with sparkles.](https://www.christianitytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Spirited-Life-The-Bibles-Challenge-to-Technofans-and-Technophobes.jpg?w=162&amp;h=88&amp;crop=1)](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/03/andrew-wilson-spirited-life-technology-bible-ambivalence/)\nrelated### [The Bible’s Challenge to Technofans and Technophobes](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/03/andrew-wilson-spirited-life-technology-bible-ambivalence/)\n[Andrew Wilson](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/andrew-wilson/)\n**Having been a new parent relatively recently, I’m very familiar Googling, “How do I get my kid to do X, Y, or Z?” I’m sure you’re right that this is a common way people are using these tools. Is it*inevitable*, though? When people speak about technology—and not just about AI—often they speak in terms of inevitability: “It’s coming. You can’t stop it. You just have to make the best of it.”**\n**And there is some truth to that. Certainly, at the individual level, I have no control. But I question it at the societal scale. I think you see a reconsideration of this kind of thinking with social media, as we’ve belatedly realized its downsides. We*do*have agency, actually. This stuff*isn’t*inevitable, and adapting and redeeming are not the only options.**\nI’m not a pastor, but if I were, I would not want my congregants to inevitably turn to computers for answers to weighty questions about parenting as a Christian. So are we resigned to a future in which people*will*take their problems to computers and all we can do is make sure they take them to computers with our values?\nIt’s so easy to sympathize with a pastor, a parent—anyone who wonders, “Hey, is this a foregone conclusion? Can we not stop the train?”\nAny child growing up today is never going to live in a world that doesn’t have AI. And I think right now, today, in first half of 2025, generally when you’re interacting with these conversational applications or these generative AI tools, you know what you’re doing—that is, I purposefully opened the ChatGPT app on my phone. I know that I’m using it.\nBut I think what we’re going to see as time goes on is that AI will become more and more embedded in more and more things that we do and use every day. It’s going to be in our cars. It’s going to be on our phones. It will be how we consume entertainment, education, what have you.\nMy belief—and, I think, the way Gloo would look at this—is that we see both an opportunity and a responsibility, not just for pastors but for all people of faith. It’s a renewed call for discernment, right?\nI think that maybe an effort to stop young people from using AI tools could be workable for some period of time. But what’s probably more likely and admittedly more nuanced is that we need to teach them how to responsibly use those tools for good.\nWith my own children, we have conversations about what they’re learning, what answers they’re getting back from AI, and how those answers square with what they know to be true. Because we’ve talked about biblical truth. We’ve talked about principles outside what they’re encountering in those tools. There’s an opportunity for pastors, parents, and educators to equip and arm people to have a truth detector and to understand that when you get answers back from AI, you don’t have to accept those outright. You should question and be curious.\nHopefully that kind of discernment is something we’ve always had, but the stakes are higher now with these tools. They speak realistically, and they give us answers that sound right, but that information requires more inspection sometimes.\nI share that hope as well—that we will be able to develop that kind of discernment. I do wonder, though, what it communicates if on the one hand we’re saying, “Hold these tools at an arm’s length. Test what you’re hearing against the truth,” but then on the other hand, when I come to my church’s website, it has an AI chatbot. That’s my church, so why would I doubt it? Isn’t that a confusing message? “Be circumspect about AI and chatbots,” but also “Here’s our chatbot. It’s good.”\nThat’s a great point. And I think you’re really getting to matters, ultimately, of trust. We should be able to trust our religious institutions or houses of faith, and they historically have been a place where trust is held in high esteem. It can also be quickly broken.\nAI tools give churches now a tremendous ability. A small church using AI can create content and repurpose content in forms and languages that would’ve been out of reach only three or five years ago. A small church of 50 people could now have a Spanish-speaking ministry if they chose. That’s a wonderful thing.\nBut to your point, if that church is choosing to use tools that are exposed to the congregation, I would agree there’s a responsibility for the church to know that tool*is*in fact trustworthy and*does*adhere to the values that the church espouses. That does create a higher burden—a higher bar, if you will—for church leaders before they put a tool out there. They need to ensure that’s an invitation to test, to explore, to be curious, to try to break the tool and make sure it’s going to answer the way the pastor would answer. Otherwise, maybe it’s not ready to go out.\n* * [More fromBonnie Kristian](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/bonnie-kristian/)\n* giftGift This Article\n* ## Share\nSharearrow\\_down\n* [facebook\\_grayscaleFacebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/gloo-ai-artificial-intelligence-church-worship-tech-ethics/)\n* [x\\_grayscaleX](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/gloo-ai-artificial-intelligence-church-worship-tech-ethics/)\n* [whatsapp\\_grayscaleWhatsApp](https://wa.me/?text=https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/gloo-ai-artificial-intelligence-church-worship-tech-ethics/)\n* [telegram\\_grayscaleTelegram](https://t.me/share/url?url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/gloo-ai-artificial-intelligence-church-worship-tech-ethics/)\n* [emailEmail]()\n* linkCopy Link\n* giftGift Article\n## Related\n[![](https://www.christianitytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/136613.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150&amp;crop=1)](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2023/10/kids-screens-tech-social-media-economic-privilege-parenting/)\n### [Blessed Are the Rich, for They Can Afford to Limit Their Kids’ Screen Time](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2023/10/kids-screens-tech-social-media-economic-privilege-parenting/)\n[Bonnie Kristian](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/bonnie-kristian/)\n[![](https://www.christianitytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/136189.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150&amp;crop=1)](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2023/09/ai-do-not-conform-work-habits-robots/)\n### [Do Not Conform to the Work Habits of AI](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2023/09/ai-do-not-conform-work-habits-robots/)\n[Bonnie Kristian](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/bonnie-kristian/)\n[![Children playing at recess](https://www.christianitytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/school-cried-wolf-article.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150&amp;crop=1)](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/christian-schools-cried-wolf/)\n### [The Christian Schools That Cried Wolf](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/christian-schools-cried-wolf/)\n[Bonnie Kristian](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/bonnie-kristian/)\n* [Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://www.christianitytoday.com/topics/artificial-intelligence-ai/)\n* [Bonnie Kristian](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/bonnie-kristian/)\n* [Church](https://www.christianitytoday.com/topics/church/)\n* [Ethics](https://www.christianitytoday.com/topics/ethics/)\n* [Technology](https://www.christianitytoday.com/topics/technology/)\n* [Worship](https://www.christianitytoday.com/topics/worship/)\n## Our Latest\n[View All](https://www.christianitytoday.com/our-latest/)\n[![A Polaroid image of two parents and their children.](https://www.christianitytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SAR-237.png?w=602)](https://www.christianitytoday.com/podcasts/the-bulletin/237-sunday-afternoon-reads-the-case-for-kids/)\nThe Bulletin\n## [Sunday Afternoon Reads: The Case for Kidspodcast\\_grayscale](https://www.christianitytoday.com/podcasts/the-bulletin/237-sunday-afternoon-reads-the-case-for-kids/)\n[Leslie Leyland Fields](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/leslie-leyland-fields/)\nLeslie Leyland Fields reads her piece about being the mom of six kids amidst our country’s declining birth rate.\n[![A picture of a dove flying in light.](https://www.christianitytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/holy-spirit-christmas-carols.jpg?w=602)](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/12/why-is-the-holy-spirit-absent-from-our-christmas-carols/)\n## [Come, Thou Long-Expected Spirit](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/12/why-is-the-holy-spirit-absent-from-our-christmas-carols/)\nW.

(OSV News illustration/Dado Ruvic, Reuters)\nAs the United States and China vie for primacy in the field of artificial intelligence, the Vatican today issued a wide-ranging reflection, called a “Note,” on “the relationship between Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence” that addresses “the anthropological and ethical challenges raised by AI” and warns against “creating a substitute for God.”\nKnown by its Latin title, “[Antiqua](https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_ddf_doc_20250128_antiqua-et-nova_en.html)[et Nova](https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_ddf_doc_20250128_antiqua-et-nova_en.html)” from the opening words of the text—“with wisdom both ancient [antiqua] and new [nova]”—the 30-page document said that “there is broad consensus that AI marks a new and significant phase in humanity’s engagement with technology, placing it at the heart of what Pope Francis has described as an ‘epochal change.’”\nIt noted that “[A.I.’s] impact is felt globally and in a wide range of areas, including interpersonal relationships, education, work, art, healthcare, law, warfare, and international relations.”\n“As AI advances rapidly toward even greater achievements,” the note said, “it is critically important to consider its anthropological and ethical implications. This involves not only mitigating risks and preventing harm but also ensuring that its applications are used to promote human progress and the common good.”\nThe document is the result of a joint effort by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, headed by the Argentine cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, and the Dicastery for Culture and Education, led by the Portuguese cardinal José Tolentino de Mendonça.\nThe text was approved by Pope Francis on Jan. 14, and released today in Italian, Spanish and English. While breaking little new ground, it brings together in one document of 117 paragraphs relevant input from the early and more recent Christian tradition, as well as from the Second Vatican Council and the magisterial teachings of Popes Paul VI, John Paul II and Benedict XVI. It draws especially on the teachings of Pope Francis, who has given great attention to A.I. throughout his pontificate and delivered the keynote address on the subject to the G7 meeting in southern Italy, on June 14, 2024.\nThe Vatican said it is offering these anthropological and ethical reflections to contribute to the ongoing global debate concerning A.I. and to assist those entrusted with transmitting the faith—including parents, teachers, pastors and bishops.\n### **Human intelligence vs. artificial intelligence**\nThe text begins “by distinguishing between concepts of intelligence in AI and in human intelligence.”\nIt recalled how the concept of “intelligence” in A.I. has evolved over time and that “a significant milestone occurred in 1956 when the American computer scientist John McCarthy organized a summer workshop at Dartmouth University to explore the problem of ‘Artificial Intelligence,’ which he defined as ‘that of making a machine behave in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving.’ That workshop launched a research program focused on designing machines capable of performing tasks typically associated with the human intellect and intelligent behavior.”\nSince then, it said, “AI research has advanced rapidly,” and, as a result, “many tasks once managed exclusively by humans are now entrusted to AI” and “many researchers aspire to develop what is known as ‘Artificial General Intelligence’ (AGI)—a single system capable of operating across all cognitive domains and performing any task within the scope of human intelligence.” Commenting on this, the Vatican noted that underlying this project “is the implicit assumption that the term ‘intelligence’ can be used in the same way to refer to both human intelligence and AI.” But, it remarked, “In the case of humans, intelligence is a faculty that pertains to the person in his or her entirety, whereas in the context of AI, ‘intelligence’ is understood functionally.”\n“Although advanced AI systems can ‘learn’ through processes such as machine learning,” the Vatican said, “this sort of training is fundamentally different from the developmental growth of human intelligence, which is shaped by embodied experiences, including sensory input, emotional responses, social interactions, and the unique context of each moment.” Moreover, “AI cannot currently replicate moral discernment or the ability to establish authentic relationships.”\n### **Ethical development of A.I.**\nPart IV of the Vatican document is devoted to “the role of ethics in guiding the development and use of AI.” It acknowledged that while technology has “remedied countless evils…not all technological advancements in themselves represent genuine human progress.” It restated the church’s opposition “to those applications [of technology] that threaten the sanctity of life or the dignity of the human person.” Like any human endeavor, it said, “technological development must be directed to serve the human person and contribute to the pursuit of greater justice, more extensive fraternity, and a more humane order of social relations.”\nThe Vatican, which has hosted several meetings on A.I. over the past decade, reported that “concerns about the ethical implications of technological development are shared not only within the church but also among many scientists, technologists, and professional associations, who increasingly call for ethical reflection to guide this development responsibly.”\nIt recalled that Pope Francis told the G7: “Technological products reflect the worldview of their developers, owners, users, and regulators, and have the power to ‘shape the world and engage consciences on the level of values.’… Therefore, the ends and the means used in a given application of AI, as well as the overall vision it incorporates, must all be evaluated to ensure they respect human dignity and promote the common good.”\n### **Social impacts of A.I.**\nPart V of the text deals with a number of specific questions, starting with A.I. and society. It recognized that “while AI holds many possibilities for promoting the good, it can also hinder or even counter human development and the common good.” It recalled that Pope Francis said: “[E]vidence to date suggests that digital technologies have increased inequality in our world. Not just differences in material wealth, which are also significant, but also differences in access to political and social influence” as well as “creating new forms of poverty.”\nIn this context, the Vatican document said that “the concentration of the power over mainstream AI applications in the hands of a few powerful companies raises significant ethical concerns.” It said, “Such entities, motivated by their own interests, possess the capacity to exercise forms of control as subtle as they are invasive, creating mechanisms for the manipulation of consciences and of the democratic process.”\nThe Vatican also warned that A.I. could further isolate people or “hinder a true encounter with reality.” Speaking of A.I., the economy and labor, the Vatican noted that A.I. is being increasingly integrated into economic and financial systems and warned that a few “large corporations” may stand to profit from A.I. more than “the businesses that use it.” It added that “while AI promises to boost productivity by taking over mundane tasks, it frequently forces workers to adapt to the speed and demands of machines rather than machines being designed to support those who work.”\nIn a section devoted to A.I. and health care, the Vatican acknowledged that while A.I. holds “immense potential in a variety of applications” in medicine, it should “enhance” but not “replace the relationship between patients and healthcare providers.”\nSimilarly, speaking of A.I. and education, the Vatican emphasized “that the physical presence of a teacher creates a relational dynamic that AI cannot replicate.” At the same time, it said, “AI presents both opportunities and challenges. If used in a prudent manner, within the context of an existing teacher-student relationship and ordered to the authentic goals of education, AI can become a valuable educational source.”\nThe Vatican also acknowledged the danger of A.I.-generated misinformation and deepfakes, warning that these could “gradually undermine the foundations of society” by “fueling political polarization and social unrest.” It called for “careful regulation” of A.I.-generated media.\nSpeaking to one of the most common criticisms of A.I., the amount of energy and water it requires and its significant contributions to CO2 levels, the Vatican said, “It is vital to develop sustainable solutions that reduce their impact on our common home.” It also listed some ways that A.I. could be used to protect the environment, including by supporting sustainable agriculture, optimizing energy usage, and providing early warning systems for public health emergencies.\nThe document next focused on A.I. and warfare. It recalled Pope Francis’ words in the 2024 Message for the World Day of Peace that “the ability to conduct military operations through remote control systems has led to a lessened perception of the devastation caused by those weapon systems and the burden of responsibility for their use, resulting in an even more cold and detached approach to the immense tragedy of war.”\nThe last topic raised by the Vatican document related to A.I. and humanity’s relationship with God. Here it stated that “the presumption of substituting God for an artifact of human making is idolatry, a practice Scripture explicitly warns against (e.g., Ex. 20:4; 32:1-5; 34:17). Moreover, AI may prove even more seductive than traditional idols for, unlike idols that ‘have mouths but do not speak; eyes, but do not see; ears, but do not hear’ (Ps. 115:5-6), AI can ‘speak,’ or at least gives the illusion of doing so (cf. Rev. 13:15).”\nIt concluded:\n> It is vital to remember that AI is but a pale reflection of humanity—it is crafted by human minds, trained on human-generated material, responsive to human input, and sustained through human labor. AI cannot possess many of the capabilities specific to human life, and it is also fallible. By turning to AI as a perceived ‘Other’ greater than itself, with which to share existence and responsibilities, humanity risks creating a substitute for God. However, it is not AI that is ultimately deified and worshipped, but humanity itself—which, in this way, becomes enslaved to its own work.\nThis article appears in[April 2025](https://www.americamagazine.org/magazine/april-2025/).\n### *Related*\n* [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2025/01/28/vatican-artificial-intelligence-document-249797/?share=facebook&#038;nb=1)\n* [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2025/01/28/vatican-artificial-intelligence-document-249797/?share=x&#038;nb=1)\n* [Click to share on Mail (Opens in new window)Mail]()\n[![oconnell](https://americamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/oconnell-170861-80x80.jpg)](https://www.americamagazine.org/author/gerard-oconnell-2/)\n## [Gerard O’Connell](https://www.americamagazine.org/author/gerard-oconnell-2/)\nGerard O’Connell is**America**’s senior Vatican correspondent and author of*The Election of Pope Francis: An Inside Story of the Conclave That Changed History*.

In this imagined future, Pastor Joshua sits across the desk from Aiden, a little boy going to the church’s summer outreach program. Aiden wants to know how he can become a Christian. He wants to repent of his sins, put his faith in Jesus, and go to heaven when he dies.\n\n## Sign up for Moore to the Point\n\nJoin Russell Moore in thinking through the important questions of the day, along with book and music recommendations he has found formative.\n\nEmail\\*\nSign Up\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) apply.\n\nThanks for signing up.\n\nExplore more newsletters—don’t forget to start your free 60-day trial of CT to get full access to all articles in every newsletter.\n\nSorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nThe catch: Aiden is manufactured, a Frankenstein’s creation of cloned human body parts with a generative AI mind. The question my students faced was “What would you advise Pastor Joshua to do?” Should he walk Aiden through the answer to the ancient query “What must I do to be saved?” (Acts 16:30). Does the “whosoever” in John 3:16 apply to him—or, should I say, to _it_?\n\nThe point of that final exam was to dislodge students from their tendency to treat ethical dilemmas like a world-view concordance of right answers to premade questions. I wanted to see not so much their answers as how they arrived at their answers—how they integrated the Bible and the gospel into a situation for which they probably didn’t have preexisting slogans.\n\n## related\n\n### [The Real Problem with AI Prayers](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/06/the-real-problem-with-ai-prayers/)\n\nAlastair Roberts\n\n### [Should We Bring AI into the Church?](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/gloo-ai-artificial-intelligence-church-worship-tech-ethics/)\n\n[Interview by Bonnie Kristian](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/bonnie-kristian/)\n\nToday, those students are still far from having great-grandchildren, yet here we all are. We’re on the cusp of what some are calling an “ [axial decade](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Future-Rearview-Mirror-Alphabet/dp/1777358914/tag=christtoday-20),” in which advances in artificial intelligence may spur on the contemporary equivalent of the [Axial Age](https://highschool.latimes.com/education/the-axial-age-a-spiritual-revolution/) (when the emergence of literacy transformed the way human beings exist in the world).\n\nPastor Joshua might not be born yet, but Aiden is here. And the church is not ready. Indeed, to talk seriously about AI is to risk causing the same reaction that many of my students had to their final—categorizing it as futuristic science fiction. But the root of our unreadiness is not that we don’t adequately understand what a chatbot is. It’s that we don’t sufficiently understand what a human being is.\n\nThe crisis of our age is a radical reducing of human life to a flow of data and information, so much so that some tech pioneers suggest eternal life can be achieved by [uploading our minds](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/60341/1/mind-uploading-key-to-eternal-life-or-terrifying-dystopia-neuralink-elon-musk) to a digital cloud. Douglas Rushkoff describes this mindset as “the belief that we can code our way out of this mess,” presuming that in a world of code, “anything that isn’t yet code can eventually be converted to a digital format as easily as a vinyl record can be translated to a streaming file.”\n\nChristians, of course, have a distinctive view of the human person as _imago Dei_—made in the image and likeness of God (Gen. 1:27). The problem is that modern Christians often unintentionally speak of this distinctiveness in terms just as machinelike as those used by the world around us.\n\nWe try to identify what “part” of us bears the image. We are morally accountable, we say, unlike other animals—and that’s true, but the Bible tells us there are other morally accountable beings in the universe (1 Cor. 6:3). Or we point to our ability for relationship—and that’s true also, but what does that say when people [fall in love with their chatbots](https://time.com/6257790/ai-chatbots-love/)?\n\nPerhaps most problematically, we speak of the _imago Dei_ as our rationality, our ability to think and to reason. But intelligence has never been exclusive to human beings. The Serpent of Eden is described as “crafty” or “cunning” (Gen. 3:1; 2 Cor. 11:3), and the apostle Paul spoke of the “schemes” of the Devil (Eph. 6:11, ESV throughout).\n\nAfter Genesis, though, the Bible doesn’t further define the concept of the image of God until the New Testament. Even then, it defines that image not as a _what_ or a _how_ but a _who_.\n\nJesus, Paul wrote, is “the image of the invisible God” (Col. 1:15). The Incarnation means that Jesus joined us in flesh and blood, in our suffering and creatureliness, in order to free us from our captivity to the power of death (Heb. 2:14–15).\n\n## recommended\n\n### [AI and All Its Splendors](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/01/ai-splendors-science-fiction-temptation-christ/)\n\n[Jeffrey Bilbro](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/jeffrey-bilbro/)\n\n### [We’re Asking the Wrong Tech Question](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/06/wrong-tech-question-artificial-intelligence-ai-church/)\n\nMitchell East\n\nAll creation is meant, somehow, to recognize humanity as signifying the reign of God (Rom. 8:19). And in the flesh-and-blood person of Jesus, it does. Even the molecular structures of fish and bread obey him and multiply. In strikingly personal terms, Jesus says, “Peace! Be still!” to the wind and waves, and they respond (Mark 4:39).\n\nPaul speaks of creation as revealing the “invisible attributes” of God (Rom. 1:20) in ways that mirror the concept of the image of God. This is not the potential to trace philosophical arguments from the order of the world back to God; the Bible says this revelation to humanity is “plain to them, because God has shown it to them” (v. 19). Something in our being is meant to resonate with the awe and mystery of the world, triggering us to recognize something—someone—behind the veil of what we can see.\n\nThe church in the AI age must recognize that to be human is not about “stuff” that can be weighed or quantified. We must understand that there’s a mystery to life that cannot be uploaded or downloaded or manipulated by technique. Simply recognizing this in an age of smart machines is a good start.\n\nThe world has always asked what the meaning of human life is. It is about to start asking what it means to be human at all. That’s a final examination question for us all.\n\nA robot can give an answer, but that’s not enough. We should point to a Person. And in an age of artificial intelligence, as always, that will be strange enough to save.\n\nRussell Moore is editor in chief at CT.\n\nThis article appeared in the [July/August 2025](https://www.christianitytoday.com/magazine/2025/july-august/) issue of [**Christianity Today**](https://www.christianitytoday.com/magazine/) as \"A Different Image of God for an Era of AI\".\n\n- [More from  Russell Moore](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/russell-moore/)\n\n- Gift This Article\n- ## Share\n\n\nShare\n\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2F2025%2F07%2Fimage-god-ai-era-artificial-intelligence-russell-moore%2F)\n- [X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2F2025%2F07%2Fimage-god-ai-era-artificial-intelligence-russell-moore%2F)\n- [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2F2025%2F07%2Fimage-god-ai-era-artificial-intelligence-russell-moore%2F)\n- [Telegram](https://t.me/share/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2F2025%2F07%2Fimage-god-ai-era-artificial-intelligence-russell-moore%2F)\n- [Email](mailto://www.christianitytoday.com?to=&subject=Christianity Today: An Image of God for an Era of AI&body=https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/07/image-god-ai-era-artificial-intelligence-russell-moore/?utm_medium=widgetemail)\n- Copy Link\n- Gift Article\n\n## Related\n\n### [The Problem of Panic](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/problem-panic-pan-peter-jesus-russell-moore/)\n\n[Russell Moore](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/russell-moore/)\n\n### [The Church Is Fragile—And Unshakable](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/03/church-fragile-unshakable-russell-moore/)\n\n[Russell Moore](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/russell-moore/)\n\n### [PEPFAR and the Uneasy Conscience of American Christianity](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/06/pepfar-bono-rogan-uneasy-conscience-american-christianity/)\n\nRUSSELL MOORE\n\n### [The Oral Majority](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/oral-majority-literacy-christianity-technology-evangelicalism-russell-moore/)\n\n[Russell Moore](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/russell-moore/)\n\n### [How I Learned to Love the Apocalypse](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/learned-love-apocalypse-revelation-russell-moore/)\n\n[Russell Moore](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/russell-moore/)\n\n- [Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://www.christianitytoday.com/topics/artificial-intelligence-ai/)\n- [Church](https://www.christianitytoday.com/topics/church/)\n- [Incarnation](https://www.christianitytoday.com/topics/incarnation/)\n- [Public Theology](https://www.christianitytoday.com/topics/public-theology/)\n- [Russell Moore](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/russell-moore/)\n- [Technology](https://www.christianitytoday.com/topics/technology/)\n\n[Christianity Today July/August 2025](https://www.christianitytoday.com/magazine/2025/july-august/)\n\n[View issue](https://www.christianitytoday.com/magazine/2025/july-august/)\n\n[Timothy Dalrymple](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/timothy-dalrymple/)\n\nMiroslav Volf\n\nKelly Kapic\n\nStephen R.

Majority of pastors now using AI to prepare sermons amid rapid embrace of technology: study\nBy[Leonardo Blair](https://www.christianpost.com/by/leonardo-blair), Senior ReporterSunday, December 07, 2025[![Facebook](https://www.christianpost.com/assets/img/facebook_square-color.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/InvestigateBlair)[![Twitter](https://www.christianpost.com/assets/img/twitter-color.svg)](https://twitter.com/leoblair)\n## Quick Summary\nAI Summary\n* Nearly two-thirds of pastors who write sermons are now using AI tools in preparation.\n* Sixty-one percent of pastors report using AI weekly or daily, up from 43% in 2024.\n* Concerns about the ethical implications of AI-generated content are rising among church leaders.\n![Unsplash/Rolf van Root ](https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/14/81/148148_w_850_567.jpg) Unsplash/Rolf van Root\nA majority of pastors are now using artificial intelligence to prepare their sermons, with ChatGPT and Grammarly reported as the top two AI tools, new survey data shows.\n\"ChatGPT is the most visible generative AI tool that can engage in human-like conversations and assist with a wide range of tasks, from answering questions to generating content,\" researchers wrote in \"[The 2025 State of AI in the Church Survey Report](https://exponential.org/product/ai-in-the-church-2025/)\" prepared by[AiForChurchLeaders.com](https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4571608-1&h=2928110859&u=https://aiforchurchleaders.com/&a=AiForChurchLeaders.com)and Exponential AI NEXT.\n\"As the most popular AI tool among church leaders (26%), ChatGPT is being used for applications such as sermon preparation, research, and crafting church communications. Its versatility and ease of use make it a powerful asset for streamlining ministry work and sparking creative ideas.\"\nThe data, based on responses from 594 pastors and church staff members, shows that church leaders are now more concerned about \"the weighty ethical and practical considerations involved\" in the use of AI as they continue their rapid embrace of the technology.\nNearly two-thirds of church leaders surveyed who prepare sermons say they use AI tools in their sermon writing process, the researchers note.\n\"This suggests that AI is quickly becoming a key tool for pastors in their weekly message preparation,\" they wrote.\nSome 61% of pastors say they use AI weekly or daily, up from 43% in 2024. In that share, 25% report using AI daily.\n\"Overall, the survey depicts a church that is increasingly open to the ministry possibilities of artificial intelligence, while still grappling with the weighty ethical and practical considerations involved,\" researchers state. \"Most churches seem to believe that AI can be beneficial if used as a tool, but not a replacement for human connection and spiritual discernment.\"\nSome 11% of church leaders report using the AI-powered writing assistant Grammarly for tasks like \"polishing emails, newsletters, blog posts, and other church communications.\" Another 9% said they use Microsoft Co-Pilot, an AI search engine developed by Microsoft, to conduct research, while 8% report using Google Gemini. Another 8% of the church leaders in the study report using Canva Magic Studio, an AI-driven set of design capabilities within the Canva design platform, to design \"social media posts, event flyers, presentation slides, generative AI fill, and other visual design functions.\"\n\"While some may view this as a concerning trend, others likely see it as a way to enhance their research, writing efficiency, and creativity,\" researchers note.  \"As AI sermon writing tools continue to improve, it will be important for church leaders to find the right balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and maintaining their unique voice and spiritual insights.\"\nAbout 30% of the leaders involved in the survey represent churches with fewer than 100 members, while about a quarter (24%) represent churches with between 100 and 249 members. Fourteen percent are leaders of churches with 250 to 499 members; 11% have 500 to 999 members; 14% have 1,000 to 4,999 members and 2% of the leaders are at churches with 5,000 to 9,999 members. Another 2% report more than 10,000 members.\n\"The demographics reveal a broad interest in AI across different leadership roles within the church, with a notable representation from Gen X and Millennials. This diversity suggests a wide acknowledgment of AI's relevance but also indicates the potential for generational divides in technology acceptance and usage,\" the report notes.\nAround half (50%) of the leaders involved in the survey are either lead pastors or executive pastors. The top concerns they had about the use of AI in ministry are now: misinformation and the theological accuracy or alignment of AI-generated content; AI replacing or diminishing personal, spiritual guidance and the quality of human relationships within the church community; privacy and data security; and transparency and accountability.\nStill, church leaders are optimistic about the use of AI in ministry and believe that, with the right training, they can overcome hurdles as they arise. Some 87% of pastors said they are willing to invest in AI education and training for themselves and their staff.\n\"To overcome known hurdles, church leaders will need to prioritize AI education and training for themselves and their staff. This could include attending workshops, partnering with AI experts, and investing in ministry-specific AI resources,\" researchers said. \"Proactively addressing ethical considerations through the development of robust AI policies and frameworks will be critical to building trust and buy-in from congregations. By taking these steps, churches can position themselves to reap the benefits of AI while mitigating potential risks.\"\nA survey released earlier this year by[Pushpay](https://pushpay.com/), a leading payments and engagement solutions provider for the faith-based and nonprofit sectors, collected in February from about 8,000 church leaders, suggests that the use of AI has increased by 80% across all ministries in churches, but only for specific tasks.\n\"While adoption (of AI) has increased, leaders remain reluctant to rely on AI for pastoral content. Last year's report revealed that less than one quarter of AI users applied the tool for developing devotionals, sermons, or ideas for pastoral care; that pattern still holds true today,\" Pushpay researchers noted. \"The vast majority of AI use cases revolve around content generation and editing of communication materials like emails, imagery, and social media posts.\"\n \nContact:[leonardo.blair@christianpost.com](mailto:leonardo.blair@christianpost.com)Follow Leonardo Blair on Twitter:[@leoblair](http://twitter.com/leoblair)Follow Leonardo Blair on Facebook:[LeoBlairChristianPost](https://www.facebook.com/LeoBlairChristianPost)\n## You’ve readarticles in the last 30 days.\n## Was this article helpful?\n**Yes**34 Votes**No**\n## Help keep The Christian Post free for everyone.\nOur work is made possible by the generosity of supporters like you.

Used with permission.\n\nBrydon Eastman was wrestling with an ethical quandary. As an applied mathematician at OpenAI, he debated what to do: Keep quiet and protect his job, or speak up and risk losing his position at a company on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence technology.\n\nEastman, 33, started his job with OpenAI in 2022, a few weeks before its famous chatbot ChatGPT debuted. The San Francisco office where Eastman worked had nap rooms, one way the company—like many others in Silicon Valley—encouraged employees to put in long hours. Those hours had gotten longer since Eastman took the job and ChatGPT rocketed to popularity and influence.\n\nFeeling overwhelmed by his dilemma, Eastman went into a nap room and shut off the lights. He prayed for an hour and a half. By the end of that time, he said, he felt clarity from God: The issue was worth confronting. He posted his thoughts on his workplace communication platform, Slack, for the entire company to see. He worried about getting fired, thinking, _This will probably cost me my equity. This will probably cost me a lot of money. But this is the right move._\n\n## Sign up for The Daily Briefing\n\nGet the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nEmail\\*\nSign Up\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) apply.\n\nThanks for signing up.\n\nExplore more newsletters—don’t forget to start your free 60-day trial of CT to get full access to all articles in every newsletter.\n\nSorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nLooking back, he said, “This is following Jesus.” The confrontation “caused some people to change some decisions,” he said. “In the end it turned out okay.” Eastman recently left OpenAI to start a new company, Thinking Machines, which lets him work on projects with which he finds himself more “philosophically aligned.”\n\nAny job can present ethical quandaries, but young Christian engineers working on AI are in the center of an unprecedented surge of technological innovation that is altering the way computers and humans interact. AI developments have also caused a rapid acceleration of tech investment—a “gold rush,” as one investment analyst [put it](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-04-02/openai-raised-the-largest-fundraising-round-ever-whats-next).\n\nIn interviews with CT, engineers in their 20s and 30s shared how they are finding themselves carried along in a surging current of AI advancements, struggling to grab at branches to anchor themselves.\n\nThey plan mathematical experiments, hunch over computers writing code, manage “data labelers”—people who annotate and categorize data used by AI models—and react in real time to the exploding amounts of new research. In crafting machines that reduce work for other humans, these engineers work longer and longer hours and often don’t feel they have time to pray through major issues that pop up. They also say they lack Christian mentors to help them navigate the rushing waters of AI.\n\nThe industry has ballooned since ChatGPT debuted. Nvidia, a chip maker used by AI companies, saw its valuation skyrocket to $3 trillion last year, making it one of the largest companies in the world. Then Chinese newcomer DeepSeek shook up the market in early 2025 when it unveiled a model that was cheaper and more efficient than those from US tech companies like OpenAI.\n\nAs the AI current flows ever faster, engineers often feel powerless to slow it down. “Even if I was 100 percent convinced \\[that\\] as a species we shouldn’t develop AI, as an individual there’s no way I could stop it,” Eastman said. “We’ve been building toward this invention for hundreds of years.”\n\nIn the past, many technological developments progressed slowly enough for humans to cultivate discernment about them, said Mike Langford, a theologian at Seattle Pacific University who studies the intersection of theology and tech. But AI innovation “has happened so quickly that we haven’t had time to develop wisdom about how we use it.”\n\nIn this newest leap of technology, Christian AI engineers could build good, ethical tools that form our lives in ways we don’t yet realize. They’re excellent mathematicians, writers of code, and creative thinkers—and they’ve come to jobs at top tech companies with a moral framework from their faith. They could help companies prioritize data privacy, code equitable algorithms, and treat humans working behind the systems fairly. But they need support. They need guidance. They need rest. There is an air of desperation in Silicon Valley, as engineers compete for a small pool of jobs while continually fearing the next round of layoffs, sources told CT. They worry the AI bubble might burst at any time.\n\nWhen he started working in AI engineering a few years ago, David Kucher, 26, reported he “felt like every minute you had to prove yourself.” He sensed “expectations of more and more and more.”\n\nEastman didn’t join the industry to get in on the AI gold rush. He started his career by researching how AI mathematics could aid cancer treatment. He has great credentials, including a “finite Erdős number” of 3, which means he is three degrees removed from publishing research with mathematician Paul Erdős—a bragging right in the discipline.\n\nBut research wasn’t to be Eastman’s path. Funding for postdoctoral studies fell through, and OpenAI recruited him. He began training machines. A large language model that forms the basis of, say, ChatGPT, takes months to train. Eastman worked in post-training, conducting mathematical experiments to prove the model could do specific tasks.\n\nPost-trainers reinforce and refine the language models with more math and human feedback, telling the model which responses are good or bad and mitigating incoherent, weird, biased, or just bad responses. That means when you ask ChatGPT a question such as “Can you give me a weather forecast for New York written in the style of a Shakespearean sonnet?” it gives a (somewhat) coherent answer.\n\nAs these young Christian AI engineers build powerful tools, they navigate the half jokes from relatives: Are you building something to destroy humanity? Something that will take my job? Something to be greater than God?\n\nFinding companions who understand the unique pressures of working in AI is key. Eastman stays in touch with one Christian mentor: Derek Schuurman, his undergrad computer science professor at Redeemer University in Hamilton, Ontario, where Eastman is from. A background at a small Christian liberal arts college is unusual in AI. Eastman’s education helped him understand that “this tech we’re building isn’t neutral,” he said. “That’s obvious to me, but that’s surprising sometimes to secular engineers or Christian engineers trained in secular institutions…. We’re imbuing particular values in these models.”\n\nIn the absence of Christian friends in AI, Eastman reads Schuurman’s book _[A Christian Field Guide to Technology for Engineers and Designers](https://www.ivpress.com/a-christian-field-guide-to-technology-for-engineers-and-designers)_. Schuurman, now a professor at Calvin University, wrote one chapter as a series of imaginary letters to a young engineer. He warns against ignoring rest, taking too much pride in high-profile projects, putting work ahead of friends and family, and falling into self-reliance from high compensation. Those tendencies don’t appear at the start of a career, he said, but set in insidiously:\n\n> Don’t forget… our entire life is a response to God.… If Christ’s lordship extends over all of life, then his lordship must also extend to engineering and technology. In the words of the late professor [Lewis Smedes](https://www.amazon.com/My-God-I-Spiritual-Memoir/dp/0802870848/tag=christtoday-20), we are called to “go into the world and create some imperfect models of the good world to come.”\n\nFrom The Haunting of Verdant Valley, a photo book by Stephen Voss. Used with permission.\n\nThe engineers who spoke with CT don’t think they’re destroying humanity, but because of the pace of their work, they are navigating their own human limitations as they experience burnout, isolation, and cutthroat company culture. Though they say they don’t feel as though their colleagues are hostile to their faith, they also don’t find many other Christians at their companies.\n\nAffinity groups exist: Google DeepMind engineer Richard Zhang started a collective called Global Christians in AI, with about 250 subscribers. He knows another DeepMind researcher who is hoping to start a Bible study at Google.\n\nBut the average programmer isn’t getting invited to Bible studies at work. Despite headlines about some Silicon Valley executives’ new interest in Christianity, employees on the ground don’t feel like they’re in the middle of some kind of Christian awakening in their offices. They all want to know more Christians in their field but in many cases haven’t found them. One goes on regular runs with his pastor, which helps. Some meet up with other tech professionals at church.\n\nFaith is “still kind of off-limits” in tech companies, and that’s a concern with all the ethical questions around AI, said Hunter Guy, the cofounder and CEO of Study Aloud, an ed tech company. She has mentored industry professionals at Progressive Baptist Church in Chicago. When they disagree with a project or find themselves burned out, Guy said, tech professionals must ask themselves, “When do I walk away?” Part of what will allow Christians to do that, she added, is understanding that “purpose doesn’t end when your job does. Calling doesn’t end when your job does.”\n\nSome Christian AI engineers sense a calling to stay in the field as long as they can. Kenya Andrews is also a member of Progressive Baptist and is friends with Guy. As a Black woman, Andrews is a minority in AI engineering. When she was a little kid, she and her dad built a computer from scratch. When she was a teen, people came to her with their computer questions.\n\nAndrews went on to become the first in her Georgia family to graduate from college. Her parents were the first in their families to graduate high school. Her paternal grandfather was a sharecropper, and her paternal grandmother was a cook and maid. They were adamant that Andrews get as much education as possible.\n\nAndrews, 30, has blown away their expectations: She recently completed a PhD in computer science from the University of Illinois Chicago. But the pressures of doing high-level machine learning research caused her to consider leaving her PhD program to go back to her old software engineering job, which suddenly felt simpler. She kept going because she felt a calling from God. She also didn’t want to let down her family or abandon the research to which she felt she could uniquely contribute.\n\nShe went into AI to research justice in algorithms or, as she puts it, to build machines that treat individual humans as who they truly are. Algorithms are determining everything from employment and parole to health care options and mortgage eligibility. Evidence is piling up that these models are built on historical data with biases against racial minorities. An engineer at a big company may not have time to think about how a seemingly small choice for an algorithmic model will affect millions; a researcher like Andrews, in academia, does.\n\nHer dissertation focused on how algorithms pull data from medical records to make health care decisions. “I think that really aligns well with ‘Love your neighbor as yourself,’ ” she said. “The Word talks about justice a lot… people who didn’t have humanity before, and \\[Jesus\\] now giving them humanity.” She added, “Everything I do is driven by me wanting to honor Christ. It’s not compartmentalized for me.”\n\nBut because of the American political climate, Andrews said it’s been difficult to find support for diversity-related research. She was thinking about applying for a National Institutes of Health grant earlier this year. When she returned to the NIH webpage two weeks later, the grant was no longer listed.\n\nLike Andrews’s family, Michael Shi’s parents are thrilled and proud that he works in AI in Silicon Valley. But for Shi, 31, the job in this cutting-edge field has been all-consuming and stressful. “It has not been a physically, emotionally, spiritually healthy place to be,” he said.\n\nHis own anger in tense moments has surprised him. On one high-profile project, frustration between him and his team escalated, which led to multiple blowups. The project was behind schedule, and he felt that the quality of work was below expectations. Meanwhile, different people on the team were vying for power.\n\nShi said he yelled and made harsh statements to his coworkers. That incident caused him to have doubts about his faith. He wondered why he felt so angry. Shouldn’t God have transformed him more by now? A Christian shouldn’t react that way, he thought.\n\nFrom The Haunting of Verdant Valley, a photo book by Stephen Voss. Used with permission.\n\nHe feels like his church friends can’t really understand what’s going on at his workplace. He doesn’t know other Christians in AI. “I had not been giving much grace to others because I had not given myself space to receive grace from the Lord,” he said. “I’m beginning to realize that the expectations I place on myself or others place on me are not the same as God’s expectations for me. God is ultimately pleased by my faithfulness.”\n\nHe tries to go for walks outside, which clear his mind. He goes to his pastor’s class on spiritual disciplines. But he knows he’s burned out.\n\nOn the other hand, Zhang at Google DeepMind doesn’t want Christian engineers to be so worried about burnout that they stop working hard. “The tension there is we’re called to be excellent,” he said. At another company he knows of, Christians have a reputation for being lazy. “It’s hard to balance.”\n\nA big part of the growing burnout is that the AI boom came shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic, which young engineers said both isolated them and erased their work-life boundaries.\n\nKucher, the AI engineer who entered the field a few years ago, started graduate school weeks before the pandemic set in. He was sitting in a room by himself facing down Zoom classes and math equations on a laptop. Work never stopped, and knowledgeable counsel was hard to come by. Now at a startup, he said, more weeks have become “bad weeks” at work. “The pace of stuff has been absolutely insane.”\n\nLike other Christian engineers, Kucher entered the industry because he wanted to create something that would help people and that they would use every day. Some of his graduate work involved improving medical imaging through machine learning.\n\nHe left one company after feeling disillusioned about its purely profit-driven product. Now he works at a company where he feels like he’s building something better. He’s spent a year and a half programming a chat application that can instantly pull together data analysis that would have taken a human a week to do. But there’s no break in sight for him.\n\n“It hurts to have things I prioritize—like exercise or volunteering at church—slowly, bit by bit, being eroded, depending on the week we’re having at work,” he said. He hasn’t found a Christian mentor in the AI field, despite trying.\n\nKucher reminds himself that his identity is not his job. He fights for time to rest. “I am a child of God,” he tells himself. “I’m valued and I’m worthy, and I’m doing my best.”\n\nEmily Belz is a senior staff writer at Christianity Today.\n\nThis article appeared in the [July/August 2025](https://www.christianitytoday.com/magazine/2025/july-august/) issue of [**Christianity Today**](https://www.christianitytoday.com/magazine/) as \"Faith in the Machine\".\n\n- [More from  Emily Belz](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/emily-belz/)\n\n- Gift This Article\n- ## Share\n\n\nShare\n\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2F2025%2F07%2Fmeet-christian-engineers-helping-shape-ai%2F)\n- [X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2F2025%2F07%2Fmeet-christian-engineers-helping-shape-ai%2F)\n- [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2F2025%2F07%2Fmeet-christian-engineers-helping-shape-ai%2F)\n- [Telegram](https://t.me/share/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2F2025%2F07%2Fmeet-christian-engineers-helping-shape-ai%2F)\n- [Email](mailto://www.christianitytoday.com?to=&subject=Christianity Today: Meet the Christian Engineers Helping to Shape AI&body=https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/07/meet-christian-engineers-helping-shape-ai/?utm_medium=widgetemail)\n- Copy Link\n- Gift Article\n\n## Related\n\n### [AI Can Preach and Sing.

December 2025-SALT LAKE CITY\nNews Release\n# Church Handbook Offers Enduring Guidance on Artificial Intelligence\n#### Members are invited to follow Jesus Christ’s example in learning, teaching and building relationships with God and others\n* [\n](#)\n* [\n]()\n* [\n](#)\n* [\n]()\n* Copied to Clipboard\n* []()\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has updated its “General Handbook” to include[principled guidance](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/38-church-policies-and-guidelines?lang=eng#p_cftM6)on the use of artificial intelligence.\nThe handbook update, published on December 16, 2025, states that AI “cannot replace the gift of divine inspiration or the individual work required to receive it.” It also cautions that “interactions with AI cannot substitute for meaningful relationships with God and others.”\nThe text encourages Latter-day Saints to follow the example of Jesus Christ as they learn, teach and develop relationships.\n“Jesus Christ taught with power and authority. He sought divine direction from His Father. He relied on the scriptures and prayer. He lived and taught only those things He learned from His Father,” the handbook says. It adds that Jesus “had a personal and sacred relationship with His Father. He prayed to His Father, learned from Him, and fulfilled His will. Jesus also had meaningful relationships with others. He listened to and talked with them, understood their needs, and ministered to them.”\nThe handbook also offers four principles to guide Latter-day Saints in the appropriate use of AI in their Church assignments.\n* If members use AI, they should do so in positive, helpful, and uplifting ways that uphold the integrity, standards, and teachings of the Church.\n* AI cannot replace the individual work and spiritual guidance required to prepare divinely inspired talks, lessons, prayers, or blessings. However, AI can be helpful for research, editing, translation, and similar tasks.\n* Leaders should not rely upon AI to provide advice to members on medical, financial, legal, or other sensitive matters. If members need assistance beyond the spiritual guidance provided by Church leaders, competent professionals may be helpful.\n* Sensitive information, such as Church records, personal member data, or confidential communications, should not be entered into AI tools that are not provided or managed by the Church.\nIn addition to this handbook update, Church leaders have taught the same principles about AI on several occasions over the past two years.\nFor example, in January 2024, Elder David A. Bednar told Brigham Young University (BYU) students that AI can be either good or bad, depending on how it is used. He encouraged them to[use AI in ways that will strengthen their moral agency](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/david-a-bednar/consider-the-wondrous-works-of-god/).\n## [![](https://d6zb2yxvzmqfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Speeches_ShareCard2024.jpeg)BYU Speeches“Consider the Wondrous Works of God” (Job 37:14)](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/david-a-bednar/consider-the-wondrous-works-of-god/)\n“Please do not allow the supposed accuracy, speed, and ease of modern technologies to entice you to avoid or circumvent the righteous work that invites into your life the blessings you will need,” he said. “My beloved brothers and sisters, there are no spiritual shortcuts or quick fixes.”\n## [![](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/b817afd49ac111ef86e00626c361eb556190244a/full/%21192%2C/0/default)Worldwide DevotionalThings as They Really Are 2.0](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2024/11/13bednar?lang=eng)\nIn a follow-up to that speech a few months later,[Elder Bednar invited](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2024/11/13bednar?lang=eng)Latter-day Saints to do two important things: “humbly and prayerfully (1) identify gospel principles that can guide their use of artificial intelligence and (2) strive sincerely for the companionship of the Holy Ghost and the spiritual gift of revelation.”\nThis is critical because, as Elder Bednar also taught, technological advancements such as AI “are part of the Lord hastening His work in the latter days.”\n## [![](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/640x480/BN-AI-Guidelines-Elder-Gong-248-03-13-24.JPG)NewsroomGuiding Principles for the Church’s Use of Artificial Intelligence](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/church-jesus-christ-artificial-intelligence)\nFellow Apostle Elder Gerrit W. Gong has also given several speeches focused on AI. In a March 2024 address, he introduced[guiding principles on the use of AI](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/church-jesus-christ-artificial-intelligence)to Church employees. And speaking at BYU in August 2025, he taught that seeking the wisdom and understanding of God should be our highest priority. Like Elder Bednar, he said AI should support —not supplant —our connection with Deity.\n## [![](https://d6zb2yxvzmqfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Speeches_ShareCard2024.jpeg)BYU SpeechesAn Ear to Wisdom, a Heart to Understanding](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/gerrit-w-gong/an-ear-to-wisdom-a-heart-to-understanding/)\n“Artificial intelligence is not God and cannot be God,”[Elder Gong said](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/elder-gong-ai-gospel-context-byu-education-week). “We can consciously choose and intentionally use AI as a tool for good [and] ... we can invite leaders and citizens across industry, research, civic and government bodies, and faith leaders to align rapid AI developments and enduring faith-based principles and moral values.”\nElder Gong emphasized that God will bless us with wisdom and understanding as we “intentionally desire and diligently seek wisdom and understanding.”\n“Artificial intelligence cannot replace revelation or generate truth from God,” he said. “We have the responsibility to ensure the Holy Ghost can attest to the truth and authenticity of all we say and share —in our form and in our content.”\n## [![](https://news-europe.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/640x480/Rome-Sunset.jpg)Europe NewsroomApostle Invites Faith and Ethics Evaluation of Artificial Intelligence Models](https://news-europe.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/elder-gong-invites-faith-and-ethics-evaluation-of-artificial-intelligence-models-at-gathering-in-rome)\nAt a Vatican City summit of faith, thought and technology leaders on AI ethics in October 2025, Elder Gong reaffirmed the need for a[Faith and Ethics AI Evaluation](https://news-europe.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/elder-gong-invites-faith-and-ethics-evaluation-of-artificial-intelligence-models-at-gathering-in-rome)for artificial intelligence models.\n“Portraying faith traditions accurately and respectfully is not an imposition of religion on AI. Rather, it is a public necessity,” Elder Gong said. “It is especially needed as increasing numbers of individuals ask AI about faith and belief, and as AI becomes a primary source of information about faith traditions.”\nLatter-day Saints are encouraged to review Church leaders’ teachings on artificial intelligence and “General Handbook” section 38.8.47, “Appropriate Use of Artificial Intelligence.”\n## Additional Resources\n* [Handbook: Appropriate Use of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/38-church-policies-and-guidelines?lang=eng#p_cftM6)\n* [The Latest Updates to the ‘General Handbook’: December 2025](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/general-handbook-update-december-2025)\n* [\n](#)\n* [\n]()\n* [\n](#)\n* [\n]()\n* Copied to Clipboard\n* []()\nClick toviewhidethe Infographic\n[](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/general-handbook-enduring-guidance-artificial-intelligence)[](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/general-handbook-enduring-guidance-artificial-intelligence&amp;amp;text=&amp;amp;via=Ch_JesusChrist)[]()[&lt; &gt;\\ \\ \\ \\ Code Copied](#)[](#)\nI agree to the Terms of Use for Media File Use.\n![]()\n![]()\n[Previous ArticleNew Guidance on Bible Translations for Latter-day Saints](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/holy-bible-translations-editions-church-of-jesus-christ)\n**Style Guide Note:**When reporting about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, please use the complete name of the Church in the first reference.
