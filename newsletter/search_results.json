The 39-page document outlines a list of general principles that Christian leaders should consider when interacting with AI, as well as several scenarios that churches may encounter as the prevalence of AI technology increases.\n\nThe document condemns any efforts to use AI to \"seek to short-circuit or cut short the process of maturation and development of wisdom.\" It warns against the use of \"AI-drafted sermons,\" asserting that \"AI can assist the pastor in preparation, but it should never be used to replace or substitute for the distinct calling upon the man of God to preach God's Word to God's people.\"\n\n\"The process of sermon development is one of the ways that God refreshes and refines the heart of the preacher,\" the guide reads. \"If it is short-circuited, valuable and personal engagement with the text is lost. As a general rule, these tools are best to use once one has done the hard work of exegesis and research, a process which must be bathed in prayer and personal reflection.\"\n\nThe document's goal is to \"equip pastors and ministry leaders as they seek to shepherd their people amid these pressing issues, ranging from the family and education to business and ministry,\" ERLC Senior Fellow Jason Thacker said in a statement.\n\n\"As we know, we can no longer keep the issues surrounding the ethical use of AI at arm's length,\" said Thacker. \"These issues now affect all of us in profound ways as technology continues to shape every aspect of our lives — both for good and ill.\"\n\nRaShan Frost, ERLC director of research and senior fellow, stressed that \"technological advances are outpacing our understanding of them and at times how we think about the moral and ethical implications of arriving technologies.\"\n\n\"Thankfully, God's Word provides us with timeless insights, commands and principles to draw from to guide us in all aspects of life and faith,\" Frost said.\n\nThe guide helps \"take God's Word, and from it draw out theological and ethical principles to help us navigate a world with artificial intelligence\" and \"take those principles and think through practical scenarios that pastors, lay leaders, staff members, and congregants may experience,\" Frost continued.\n\nRegarding the prospect of church leaders employing AI assistants, the guide advises against the use of AI in a way that ends up \"replacing key aspects of another person's ministry,\" once again maintaining that the technology should only be used as a supplement.\n\n\"We must never seek to employ AI and other emerging technologies in ways that diminish the dignity of any human being by using AI as a means to subvert the human calling as image bearers of God to shape the world around them,\" the document declares. \"AI must only be used in ways that complement \\[the\\] holistic transformation\" that results from the \"godly\" development of \"the whole person, including our minds, bodies, and hearts.\"\n\nAdditionally, the guide warns that AI \"should never be a substitute for or replacement for a rich embodied community, ultimately with God and with other human beings.\"\n\n\"Any faithful approach to AI and emerging technologies must be rooted in the transcendent nature of God and his sovereign control over all things, including even the most advanced AI systems,\" the guide states.\n\nThe document stresses that technologies, including AI, \"must only be developed, deployed, evaluated, and used in ways that champion the immeasurable dignity of all people.\"\n\nAs the world debates how to respond to the rapid development of AI technology, The Christian Post, Colorado Christian University and Gloo will co-host a summit on Oct. 7 titled \" [AI For Humanity: Navigating Ethics and Morality for a Flourishing Future](https://www.christianpost.com/news/the-christian-post-ccu-gloo-to-host-summit-on-ai-and-faith.html).\"\n\nThe event, which will take place at Colorado Christian University in Lakewood, Colorado, will feature \"keynote addresses, panel discussions and interactive sessions designed to equip Christian higher education institutions, students and tech innovators with strategies to responsibly integrate AI within a faith-informed framework.\"\n\nRyan Foley is a reporter for The Christian Post.

(OSV News illustration/Dado Ruvic, Reuters)\nVATICAN CITY (CNS) -- \"Technological progress is part of God's plan for creation,\" the Vatican said, but people must take responsibility for using technologies like artificial intelligence to help humanity and not harm individuals or groups.\n\"Like any tool, AI is an extension of human power, and while its future capabilities are unpredictable, humanity's past actions provide clear warnings,\" said the document signed by Cardinals Víctor Manuel Fernández, prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, and José Tolentino de Mendonça, prefect of the Dicastery for Culture and Education.\nThe document, approved by Pope Francis Jan. 14 and released by the Vatican Jan. 28 -- the day after International Holocaust Remembrance Day -- said \"the atrocities committed throughout history are enough to raise deep concerns about the potential abuses of AI.\"\nTitled,[\"Antiqua et Nova (ancient and new): Note on the Relationship Between Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence,\"](https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_ddf_doc_20250128_antiqua-et-nova_en.html)the document focused particularly on the moral use of technology and on the impact artificial intelligence already is having or could have on interpersonal relationships, education, work, art, health care, law, warfare and international relations.\nAI technology is used not only in apps like ChatGPT and search engines, but in advertising, self-driving cars, autonomous weapons systems, security and surveillance systems, factory robotics and data analysis, including in health care.\n![Pope Francis speaks about AI at a G7 meeting](https://www.usccb.org/sites/default/files/2025-01/20240614T1100-POPE-G7-AI-1778245.JPG)Pope Francis gives a speech on the benefits and dangers of artifical intelligence to world leaders attending the Group of Seven summit in Borgo Egnazia in Italy's southern Puglia region, June 14, 2024. (CNS photo/Vatican Media)\nThe popes and Vatican institutions, particularly the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, have been monitoring and raising concerns about the development and use of artificial intelligence for more than 40 years.\n\"Like any product of human creativity, AI can be directed toward positive or negative ends,\" the Vatican document said. \"When used in ways that respect human dignity and promote the well-being of individuals and communities, it can contribute positively to the human vocation.\"\n\"Yet, as in all areas where humans are called to make decisions, the shadow of evil also looms here,\" the dicasteries said. \"Where human freedom allows for the possibility of choosing what is wrong, the moral evaluation of this technology will need to take into account how it is directed and used.\"\nHuman beings, not machines, make moral decisions, the document said. So, \"it is important that ultimate responsibility for decisions made using AI rests with the human decision-makers and that there is accountability for the use of AI at each stage of the decision-making process.\"\nThe Vatican document insisted that while artificial intelligence can quickly perform some very complex tasks or access vast amounts of information, it is not truly intelligent, at least not in the same way human beings are.\n![Cardinal Tolentino de Mendonca at a news conference](https://www.usccb.org/sites/default/files/2025-01/20250128T0630-FILE-CARDINAL-TOLENTINO-MENDONCA-1789111.JPG)Cardinal José Tolentino de Mendonça, prefect of the Dicastery for Culture and Education, speaks at a Vatican news conference in this file photo from Oct. 17, 2023. (CNS photo/Lola Gomez)\n\"A proper understanding of human intelligence,\" it said, \"cannot be reduced to the mere acquisition of facts or the ability to perform specific tasks. Instead, it involves the person's openness to the ultimate questions of life and reflects an orientation toward the true and the good.\"\nHuman intelligence also involves listening to others, empathizing with them, forming relationships and making moral judgments -- actions which even the most sophisticated AI programs cannot do, it said.\n\"Between a machine and a human, only the human can be sufficiently self-aware to the point of listening and following the voice of conscience, discerning with prudence, and seeking the good that is possible in every situation,\" the document said.\nThe Vatican dicasteries issued several warnings or cautions in the document, calling on individual users, developers and even governments to exercise control over how AI is used and to commit \"to ensuring that AI always supports and promotes the supreme value of the dignity of every human being and the fullness of the human vocation.\"\n![Cardinal Fernandez speaks at a Vatican news conference](https://www.usccb.org/sites/default/files/2025-01/20250128T0630-FILE-CARDINAL-FERNANDEZ-1789110.JPG)Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, speaks to reporters at the Vatican in this file photo from Sept. 19, 2024. (CNS photo/Justin McLellan)\nFirst, they said, \"misrepresenting AI as a person should always be avoided; doing so for fraudulent purposes is a grave ethical violation that could erode social trust. Similarly, using AI to deceive in other contexts -- such as in education or in human relationships, including the sphere of sexuality -- is also to be considered immoral and requires careful oversight to prevent harm, maintain transparency, and ensure the dignity of all people.\"\nThe dicasteries warned that \"AI could be used to perpetuate marginalization and discrimination, create new forms of poverty, widen the 'digital divide,' and worsen existing social inequalities.\"\nWhile AI promises to boost productivity in the workplace \"by taking over mundane tasks,\" the document said, \"it frequently forces workers to adapt to the speed and demands of machines rather than machines being designed to support those who work.\"\nParents, teachers and students also need to be careful with their reliance on AI, it said, and they need to know its limits.\n\"The extensive use of AI in education could lead to the students' increased reliance on technology, eroding their ability to perform some skills independently and worsening their dependence on screens,\" it said.\nAnd while AI may provide information, the document said, it does not actually educate, which requires thinking, reasoning and discerning.\n![The ChatGPT app on a phone](https://www.usccb.org/sites/default/files/2025-01/20240308T1115-BENANTI-ALGORITHMS-1773599.JPG)The ChatGPT app is seen on a phone placed atop a keyboard in this photo taken in Rome March 8, 2024. (CNS photo/Lola Gomez)\nUsers must also be aware of AI's \"serious risk of generating manipulated content and false information, which can easily mislead people due to its resemblance to the truth. Such misinformation might occur unintentionally, as in the case of AI 'hallucination,' where a generative AI system yields results that appear real but are not\" because it is programmed to respond to every request for information, regardless of whether it has access to it.\nOf course, the document said, AI's falsehood also \"can be intentional: individuals or organizations intentionally generate and spread false content with the aim to deceive or cause harm, such as 'deepfake' images, videos and audio -- referring to a false depiction of a person, edited or generated by an AI algorithm.\"\nMilitary applications of AI technology are particularly worrisome, the document said, because of \"the ease with which autonomous weapons make war more viable,\" AI's potential for removing \"human oversight\" from weapons deployment and the possibility that autonomous weapons will become the object of a new \"destabilizing arms race, with catastrophic consequences for human rights.\n## CATHOLIC NEWS SERVICE\nWith its Rome bureau founded in 1950, Catholic News Service has been providing complete, in-depth coverage of the popes and the Vatican for more than 70 years.

(OSV News illustration/Dado Ruvic, Reuters)\nAs the United States and China vie for primacy in the field of artificial intelligence, the Vatican today issued a wide-ranging reflection, called a “Note,” on “the relationship between Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence” that addresses “the anthropological and ethical challenges raised by AI” and warns against “creating a substitute for God.”\nKnown by its Latin title, “[Antiqua](https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_ddf_doc_20250128_antiqua-et-nova_en.html)[et Nova](https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_ddf_doc_20250128_antiqua-et-nova_en.html)” from the opening words of the text—“with wisdom both ancient [antiqua] and new [nova]”—the 30-page document said that “there is broad consensus that AI marks a new and significant phase in humanity’s engagement with technology, placing it at the heart of what Pope Francis has described as an ‘epochal change.’”\nIt noted that “[A.I.’s] impact is felt globally and in a wide range of areas, including interpersonal relationships, education, work, art, healthcare, law, warfare, and international relations.”\n“As AI advances rapidly toward even greater achievements,” the note said, “it is critically important to consider its anthropological and ethical implications. This involves not only mitigating risks and preventing harm but also ensuring that its applications are used to promote human progress and the common good.”\nThe document is the result of a joint effort by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, headed by the Argentine cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, and the Dicastery for Culture and Education, led by the Portuguese cardinal José Tolentino de Mendonça.\nThe text was approved by Pope Francis on Jan. 14, and released today in Italian, Spanish and English. While breaking little new ground, it brings together in one document of 117 paragraphs relevant input from the early and more recent Christian tradition, as well as from the Second Vatican Council and the magisterial teachings of Popes Paul VI, John Paul II and Benedict XVI. It draws especially on the teachings of Pope Francis, who has given great attention to A.I. throughout his pontificate and delivered the keynote address on the subject to the G7 meeting in southern Italy, on June 14, 2024.\nThe Vatican said it is offering these anthropological and ethical reflections to contribute to the ongoing global debate concerning A.I. and to assist those entrusted with transmitting the faith—including parents, teachers, pastors and bishops.\n### **Human intelligence vs. artificial intelligence**\nThe text begins “by distinguishing between concepts of intelligence in AI and in human intelligence.”\nIt recalled how the concept of “intelligence” in A.I. has evolved over time and that “a significant milestone occurred in 1956 when the American computer scientist John McCarthy organized a summer workshop at Dartmouth University to explore the problem of ‘Artificial Intelligence,’ which he defined as ‘that of making a machine behave in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving.’ That workshop launched a research program focused on designing machines capable of performing tasks typically associated with the human intellect and intelligent behavior.”\nSince then, it said, “AI research has advanced rapidly,” and, as a result, “many tasks once managed exclusively by humans are now entrusted to AI” and “many researchers aspire to develop what is known as ‘Artificial General Intelligence’ (AGI)—a single system capable of operating across all cognitive domains and performing any task within the scope of human intelligence.” Commenting on this, the Vatican noted that underlying this project “is the implicit assumption that the term ‘intelligence’ can be used in the same way to refer to both human intelligence and AI.” But, it remarked, “In the case of humans, intelligence is a faculty that pertains to the person in his or her entirety, whereas in the context of AI, ‘intelligence’ is understood functionally.”\n“Although advanced AI systems can ‘learn’ through processes such as machine learning,” the Vatican said, “this sort of training is fundamentally different from the developmental growth of human intelligence, which is shaped by embodied experiences, including sensory input, emotional responses, social interactions, and the unique context of each moment.” Moreover, “AI cannot currently replicate moral discernment or the ability to establish authentic relationships.”\n### **Ethical development of A.I.**\nPart IV of the Vatican document is devoted to “the role of ethics in guiding the development and use of AI.” It acknowledged that while technology has “remedied countless evils…not all technological advancements in themselves represent genuine human progress.” It restated the church’s opposition “to those applications [of technology] that threaten the sanctity of life or the dignity of the human person.” Like any human endeavor, it said, “technological development must be directed to serve the human person and contribute to the pursuit of greater justice, more extensive fraternity, and a more humane order of social relations.”\nThe Vatican, which has hosted several meetings on A.I. over the past decade, reported that “concerns about the ethical implications of technological development are shared not only within the church but also among many scientists, technologists, and professional associations, who increasingly call for ethical reflection to guide this development responsibly.”\nIt recalled that Pope Francis told the G7: “Technological products reflect the worldview of their developers, owners, users, and regulators, and have the power to ‘shape the world and engage consciences on the level of values.’… Therefore, the ends and the means used in a given application of AI, as well as the overall vision it incorporates, must all be evaluated to ensure they respect human dignity and promote the common good.”\n### **Social impacts of A.I.**\nPart V of the text deals with a number of specific questions, starting with A.I. and society. It recognized that “while AI holds many possibilities for promoting the good, it can also hinder or even counter human development and the common good.” It recalled that Pope Francis said: “[E]vidence to date suggests that digital technologies have increased inequality in our world. Not just differences in material wealth, which are also significant, but also differences in access to political and social influence” as well as “creating new forms of poverty.”\nIn this context, the Vatican document said that “the concentration of the power over mainstream AI applications in the hands of a few powerful companies raises significant ethical concerns.” It said, “Such entities, motivated by their own interests, possess the capacity to exercise forms of control as subtle as they are invasive, creating mechanisms for the manipulation of consciences and of the democratic process.”\nThe Vatican also warned that A.I. could further isolate people or “hinder a true encounter with reality.” Speaking of A.I., the economy and labor, the Vatican noted that A.I. is being increasingly integrated into economic and financial systems and warned that a few “large corporations” may stand to profit from A.I. more than “the businesses that use it.” It added that “while AI promises to boost productivity by taking over mundane tasks, it frequently forces workers to adapt to the speed and demands of machines rather than machines being designed to support those who work.”\nIn a section devoted to A.I. and health care, the Vatican acknowledged that while A.I. holds “immense potential in a variety of applications” in medicine, it should “enhance” but not “replace the relationship between patients and healthcare providers.”\nSimilarly, speaking of A.I. and education, the Vatican emphasized “that the physical presence of a teacher creates a relational dynamic that AI cannot replicate.” At the same time, it said, “AI presents both opportunities and challenges. If used in a prudent manner, within the context of an existing teacher-student relationship and ordered to the authentic goals of education, AI can become a valuable educational source.”\nThe Vatican also acknowledged the danger of A.I.-generated misinformation and deepfakes, warning that these could “gradually undermine the foundations of society” by “fueling political polarization and social unrest.” It called for “careful regulation” of A.I.-generated media.\nSpeaking to one of the most common criticisms of A.I., the amount of energy and water it requires and its significant contributions to CO2 levels, the Vatican said, “It is vital to develop sustainable solutions that reduce their impact on our common home.” It also listed some ways that A.I. could be used to protect the environment, including by supporting sustainable agriculture, optimizing energy usage, and providing early warning systems for public health emergencies.\nThe document next focused on A.I. and warfare. It recalled Pope Francis’ words in the 2024 Message for the World Day of Peace that “the ability to conduct military operations through remote control systems has led to a lessened perception of the devastation caused by those weapon systems and the burden of responsibility for their use, resulting in an even more cold and detached approach to the immense tragedy of war.”\nThe last topic raised by the Vatican document related to A.I. and humanity’s relationship with God. Here it stated that “the presumption of substituting God for an artifact of human making is idolatry, a practice Scripture explicitly warns against (e.g., Ex. 20:4; 32:1-5; 34:17). Moreover, AI may prove even more seductive than traditional idols for, unlike idols that ‘have mouths but do not speak; eyes, but do not see; ears, but do not hear’ (Ps. 115:5-6), AI can ‘speak,’ or at least gives the illusion of doing so (cf. Rev. 13:15).”\nIt concluded:\n> It is vital to remember that AI is but a pale reflection of humanity—it is crafted by human minds, trained on human-generated material, responsive to human input, and sustained through human labor. AI cannot possess many of the capabilities specific to human life, and it is also fallible. By turning to AI as a perceived ‘Other’ greater than itself, with which to share existence and responsibilities, humanity risks creating a substitute for God. However, it is not AI that is ultimately deified and worshipped, but humanity itself—which, in this way, becomes enslaved to its own work.\nThis article appears in[April 2025](https://www.americamagazine.org/magazine/april-2025/).\n### *Related*\n* [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Facebook](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2025/01/28/vatican-artificial-intelligence-document-249797/?share=facebook&#038;nb=1)\n* [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)X](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2025/01/28/vatican-artificial-intelligence-document-249797/?share=x&#038;nb=1)\n* [Click to share on Mail (Opens in new window)Mail]()\n[![oconnell](https://americamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/oconnell-170861-80x80.jpg)](https://www.americamagazine.org/author/gerard-oconnell-2/)\n## [Gerard O’Connell](https://www.americamagazine.org/author/gerard-oconnell-2/)\nGerard O’Connell is**America**’s senior Vatican correspondent and author of*The Election of Pope Francis: An Inside Story of the Conclave That Changed History*.

ChatGPT, the most famous of large language models (LLMs)—programs that can function as chatbots, create content, and perform administrative tasks based on conversational instructions from users—launched in late 2022. Since then, LLMs have rapidly progressed in their capabilities and are increasingly integrated into our digital lives.\n\nBut should they be [integrated into](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2023/07/ai-chatgpt-exegetical-tool-bible-scripture-sermon-mount/) our _spiritual_ lives? Should [pastors use](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2023/09/ai-has-no-place-in-pulpit-chatgpt-llm-openai-preaching-past/) LLMs to [write sermons](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2023/09/chatgpt-ai-ministry-pastoral-taiwan/) or [reformat sermon content](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJA0gamhkOR/) into small-group study guides? Should church websites have chatbots on hand to answer visitors’ questions around the clock? Is there a role for AI in [discipleship and catechesis](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2023/01/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-ai-preach-sermons-church/)?\n\nMy own answer (others at CT may hold different views) to all those questions is _no._ While I do see some practical uses for AI—like transcribing the dialogue below, with a backstop of full human review—I’m deeply wary of proposals to bring LLMs and similar AI tools into the life of the church. I believe that chatbots have no place in spiritual formation or pastoral care and that even many simpler applications, like telling a potential visitor when the Sunday service starts, are already amply handled by regular old websites.\n\n## Sign up for The Daily Briefing\n\nGet the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nEmail\\*\nSign Up\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) apply.\n\nThanks for signing up.\n\nExplore more newsletters—don’t forget to start your free 60-day trial of CT to get full access to all articles in every newsletter.\n\nSorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nThose instincts made me curious about Gloo, a dominant player in the “Christian AI” space. The Colorado-based company brands itself as “the leading technology platform dedicated to connecting the faith ecosystem,” [and last summer](https://religionnews.com/2024/07/31/gloo-secures-110-million-strategic-growth-investment/) it announced $110 million in new venture capital funding.\n\n[Gloo promises](https://gloo.com/ai/products/chat) “AI you can trust for life’s biggest questions,” a chatbot that “guides you to real answers and next steps for a life that matters.” An animation on its site suggests that users ask the chatbot “anything” about the Bible, politics, religion, relationships, and more.\n\nGloo offers “verified” answers from “reliable sources” that are “biblically sound” and “grounded in faith-based principles” so it can “guide you and those you care about with confidence.” But equally— [on the same page, in the same list](https://gloo.com/ai/products/chat)—the company offers personalization so individual users can get answers that reflect what they already believe.\n\n“Customize your experience with filters that align with your values, ensuring every result reflects what matters most to you,” the site says next to an illustration apparently suggesting users can reject an information source for their personal AI interface.\n\nThis language left me wondering what it means to make [what Gloo calls](https://gloo.com/ai) “values-aligned” AI. The company first connected me to its chief AI officer, Steele Billings. Our conversation centered on the technology, and Billings explained that Gloo uses Microsoft’s [Responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai), then layers its own standards and training data from Christian sources on top.\n\nThat starts with Harvard’s [Global Flourishing Study](https://hfh.fas.harvard.edu/global-flourishing-study), which [defines human flourishing](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/global-flourishing-study-good-life/) in [six dimensions](https://hfh.fas.harvard.edu/measuring-flourishing): “happiness and life satisfaction, physical and mental health, meaning and purpose, character and virtue,” “close social relationships,” and “financial and material stability.” To that list, with help from evangelical polling firm the Barna Group, Billings told me, Gloo added a seventh dimension of faith and spirituality.\n\nrelated\n\n### [Measuring the Good Life](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/global-flourishing-study-good-life/)\n\nBrendan Case, Katelyn N. G. Long, Tyler J. VanderWeele, and Byron R. Johnson\n\nOf course, people of faith are famously prone to disagreement about the truth—thus the personalization. Gloo tools can be customized by individual, congregational and denominational users, Billings said: “One of the things that our technology does is it will go out when a church signs up” and “pull the statement of faith off the church website” so it can “answer questions that are aligned with that statement of faith.”\n\nThat customization even extends outside the church, Billings confirmed when I asked about other religions, like Judaism or Islam. “While today you would see mostly Protestant organizations on our platform,” he told me, “we do not prohibit in any way a Muslim organization from coming in and using our technology.”\n\nLater this spring, I also spoke with Brad Hill, Gloo’s chief solutions officer. That conversation, which turned from the technical details to Gloo’s philosophy of AI development and function, is below. It has been edited and condensed.\n\nEditor’s note: Christianity Today has partnered with Gloo on advertising projects in the past, including the development of branded content about [AI and the church](https://www.christianitytoday.com/partners/gloo/ai-and-the-church/). These projects have never involved CT’s editorial team and had no influence on this article.\n\nI’d like to focus here on some higher-level questions about the purpose, goals, and visions that Gloo has for the Kingdom-Aligned Large Language Model (KALLM) and for your work with churches in particular. Let’s start with something your colleague, Steele Billings, said when we spoke about the technical side of this work: “Technology is neutral,” and it’s about what we choose to do with it, what kind of worldview we bring to that task, whether it’s a biblical worldview. Is that Gloo’s mindset? If yes, what does that look like? How do you think about it?\n\nThat’s a great starting point. Yes, that is what we would contend: The technology is neutral.\n\nPut another way, I’ve heard it described as amoral. It’s neither good nor bad. It can certainly be applied for things that are quite bad, but also it can be applied for things that are incredibly good and incredibly redemptive.\n\nOur contention is that in every other station of culture, wherever we look in the world, technology is being used. And our strong belief is that the church—and those in ministry and, as we would say, the faith and flourishing ecosystem—needs to be equipped with the very same tools for good. It’s important. It’s not a “nice to have” anymore.\n\nOne reason is that technology is more than just tools, bits and bytes. It’s shaping culture. Look at what happened with social media over the last decade plus. Look at the internet and how it’s affected every station of life. AI is now a very similar phenomenon that’s upon us. So while the technology itself might be classified as neutral, we would contend strongly that people who are in the business of flourishing and people who are trying to advance good need to be equipped with the very best tech so that they can apply it to that end.\n\nrecommended\n\n### [AI Will Shape Your Soul](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2023/09/artificial-intelligence-robots-soul-formation/)\n\n[Kate Lucky](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/kate-lucky/)\n\nIf I can probe that a little bit, I think there are many uses of AI that are pretty uncontroversial: people who use it as a search engine, for example, or administrative functions like scheduling meetings. Where it tends to be controversial, as you no doubt know, is around creating material—for instance, writing sermons or study guides based on sermons. And so that affirmation that the technology is neutral, is that truly across-the-board for Gloo? Or are there areas that you would say are off-limits?\n\nIt’s an interesting question, and I think honestly there are different answers to that question depending on whether you have AI tools that are built with a values alignment or not.\n\nWe don’t say technology is neutral if we’re dealing with tools that just have a general-market use, which is mostly what the public is familiar with right now. Even your example that was somewhat innocuous—of using ChatGPT as a search engine—I would contend that’s _not_ neutral, because most folks may not fully understand where ChatGPT is getting its results, and those results are likely not aligned to the values of someone who follows Christianity or adheres to biblical truth. If you ask questions on matters of ethics and deeply felt needs, you may get answers that are antithetical to Scripture.\n\nHowever, when you have tools that are built on more of a biblical foundation and aligned to human flourishing values, I would say my answer broadens regarding what’s within bounds. Because then you feel a lot more confident turning to these tools to answer questions around some of those weightier issues. That’s exactly what we see at Gloo.\n\nRight now, there’s a gap in the market for generative AI tools that are trained on the values we hold. So for instance, I could ask ChatGPT to help me plan dinner. I think ChatGPT is a wonderful tool for that or for scheduling, as you said. But when we’re asking these weightier questions around faith, ethics, and morality, we want tools built on a model that’s been trained on proper values.\n\nAnd that’s what Gloo is building now. We’re ultimately not looking to fully _replace_ tools like ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini but to _complement_ them and leverage the good that’s in all of them so that we have an incredible tool that can tell me what to make for dinner _and_ can help me as a parent or in a relationship or when I’m exploring faith.\n\nIt’s funny you mention a market gap, because that’s my next question. You think about the classic inventor—say, Eli Whitney and the cotton gin. We can see the market gap there: We don’t want to process this cotton by hand anymore. Here, yes, there’s a market gap in the sense you’re describing: These other LLMs have different values, and maybe their makers present these tools as ethically neutral when really they’re not. So for Gloo, the market gap is for an LLM with biblically informed values.\n\nBut I want to ask about a market gap in a different sense, which is: What is the lack in the church that this tool is filling? What is it that 2,000 years of Christianity didn’t have that this AI is going to provide?\n\nYou mean what is AI itself filling as a gap?\n\n**Yeah, what is the gap in the church?**\n\nWell, the premise of your question is that we have this timeless gospel message that is complete and sufficient, and we start there. However, what’s also true is that in the world around us, culture constantly moves.\n\nEven in biblical times, we saw examples of technology. Jesus used the Roman roads. Later on, we had the printing press. When the printing press was first invented, there were plenty of religious leaders decrying that as unnecessary or even evil. So all throughout history, we have examples where initially people of faith are skeptical of a new technology. What happens every time, though, is that culture responds to that new technology and there are new standards or practices that emerge. As Christians, we’re then faced with the question of how we apply this timeless gospel to what’s changed.\n\nThink of the average congregation: maybe 150 people, a pastor, maybe a youth pastor or secretary. They worship together every Sunday. When you look at that church, what part of that do you see and say, “We need to put AI in there?” Is it the service? Is it the pastoral care? It doesn’t sound like it’s just the scheduling.\n\nYeah, well, I mean, it doesn’t matter what size church you are. You could be giant, or you could be a hundred people. Like you said, the people in your church are experiencing the most dramatic shift we’ve ever seen in humanity. I mean, AI is affecting them as parents. It’s affecting them in relationships and as workers in jobs. So when our surveys have come back, what we hear is people in churches are interested in their pastors and their leaders helping them navigate this new post-AI world. That’s one thing.\n\nAnd yes, there are tools that can help with the operational side of church too. It can help us with content repurposing. It can help us with language translation and other administrative tasks.\n\nBut we also think, as we get deeper into this, that there’s a profound and lasting impact on every life and every church from AI, and the church has an opportunity now to think about how we understand what’s going on and how we equip our people to navigate whatever questions or whatever challenges are coming at them outside the church. The church can be a place where we can come to learn how to navigate a post-AI world.\n\nI think that’s vital, and pastors should absolutely help us navigate the post-AI world. But what I would want to distinguish here is that there seems to me to be a big difference between one, that guidance, and two, using an AI chatbot to ask personal spiritual questions.\n\nFor instance, when I emailed with your colleague Chase Cappo, Gloo’s AI enterprise director, he mentioned—and I believe he was talking about KALLM, but correct me if I’m wrong—that there’d already been more than 10 million conversations with Gloo’s Christian AI app. He said that people were “getting more personal than with most pastors.” And I don’t know about you, but I’m a parent, and if I found out my kid was taking personal spiritual questions to a chatbot instead of me or our pastor or another trusted adult human, I would be highly alarmed.\n\nI think there’s a very big difference between pastors helping Christians navigate a post-AI world and pastors providing Christians with a tool that has no soul so they can talk to it about the state of their spirits, the state of their relationships with God.\n\nWell, first of all, as a parent, cannot agree more with your sentiment.\n\nAnd I would also just share we have a core principle at Gloo, and the way we phrase it is that relationships catalyze growth. Our belief is that God has wired each and every one of us to really grow best in the context of relationship, not in the context of interacting with an app or with content or what have you.\n\nSo when you hear us talk, for example, about values-aligned AI, one of the principles that really drives our work is thinking about how these tools _support_ a relationship rather than _replacing_ a relationship. And there is a danger of that with the tools we see today. You illustrated one example, where someone might turn to a chat tool in lieu of a person.\n\nAs we navigate this at Gloo, one of the principles we want to literally design into any tool that supports human flourishing is not just to provide a helpful, productive answer to someone’s question but to point them toward discussing it further, getting into a conversation, making a connection with someone. You’re not going to see most general-market tools behave that way for various reasons. We believe that every tool should support relationship.\n\nrelated\n\n### [The Silicon Calf](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/04/the-silicon-calf-artificial-general-intelligence-idolatry-faith/)\n\nA.G. Elrod\n\n**Practically speaking, would that look like? For instance, certain keywords would prompt the tool to say, “Hey, go talk to your pastor about this”?**\n\nYeah. Well, in the example that Chase gave you, we have a set of tools called assistants that are placed in various spots. They might be on church websites, or they might be in apps—little chatbots and the like. They’re built with a feature called escalation. We’re learning patterns of when a conversation is appropriate to conduct via chatbot. Like, “What time are the services on Sunday?” “Do you have children’s programming?” Those are fairly administrative, factual questions.\n\nBut when the conversations get a little bit more sensitive or lose appropriateness for the chatbot, the tool is going to say, “That’s a great question. Let me see if I can connect you to someone at the church who can explain more.” And that then escalates the conversation away from AI to humans. That’s an example of how we support a relationship. We’re not looking keep the conversation in a chatbot forever. We want to eventually make a human connection.\n\nYou mentioned regular ChatGPT could be damaging to our social, spiritual, or relational health because it _does_ have values—and perhaps values we don’t even notice. But if there’s a new technology being used to some negative or at best neutral end, to my mind it doesn’t clearly follow that Christians should just put out the modified “Christian” version of it. There are, I think, some things where we just have to say, “No, that’s not something we’re going to try to redeem.”\n\nDo you see a line like that coming up in the future of AI as it progresses? Or is this particular technology a case where we _can_ do a modified Christian version? I’m not going to hold you to this 50 years down the line, of course, if AI takes an unanticipated swerve. But so far as we can see, is this something we can continue modifying to our purposes?\n\nI’m tracking with your question. When we use AI as an umbrella term, it refers to such a vast set of technologies and tools and capabilities that we’re really just beginning to understand. So it’s kind of like asking, “Are there guardrails where books should not be used for certain things? Or where the internet should not be used?” I mean, it is quite broad.\n\nIn that sense, the answer has to be yes. Of course there will be certain applications and uses that, no matter how much you try to redeem it, will destroy human flourishing. They’re going to be antithetical to it. The list would probably be what you’d expect, nefarious or destructive uses around mental health, adult entertainment, and so on.\n\nBut I think that it would be hard to just outright discard AI or chatbots or any similar category, because each of them can be applied to save lives and find cures for cancer. They can also be applied to negatively affect mental health. The opportunity, I think, and the challenge for us is to distinguish between uses, like between what I cook for dinner and how I parent through a hard situation.\n\nWe don’t need a modified Christian version to teach me how to cook, but we do need it for matters of ethics, mental health, faith, and so on. That’s the nuance where we’re applying a values-aligned layer over top of the existing tools, not trying to create a replacement for what’s already out there.\n\nrelated\n\n### [The Bible’s Challenge to Technofans and Technophobes](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/03/andrew-wilson-spirited-life-technology-bible-ambivalence/)\n\n[Andrew Wilson](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/andrew-wilson/)\n\n**Having been a new parent relatively recently, I’m very familiar Googling, “How do I get my kid to do X, Y, or Z?” I’m sure you’re right that this is a common way people are using these tools. Is it _inevitable_, though? When people speak about technology—and not just about AI—often they speak in terms of inevitability: “It’s coming. You can’t stop it. You just have to make the best of it.”**\n\n**And there is some truth to that. Certainly, at the individual level, I have no control. But I question it at the societal scale. I think you see a reconsideration of this kind of thinking with social media, as we’ve belatedly realized its downsides. We _do_ have agency, actually. This stuff _isn’t_ inevitable, and adapting and redeeming are not the only options.**\n\nI’m not a pastor, but if I were, I would not want my congregants to inevitably turn to computers for answers to weighty questions about parenting as a Christian. So are we resigned to a future in which people _will_ take their problems to computers and all we can do is make sure they take them to computers with our values?\n\nIt’s so easy to sympathize with a pastor, a parent—anyone who wonders, “Hey, is this a foregone conclusion? Can we not stop the train?”\n\nAny child growing up today is never going to live in a world that doesn’t have AI. And I think right now, today, in first half of 2025, generally when you’re interacting with these conversational applications or these generative AI tools, you know what you’re doing—that is, I purposefully opened the ChatGPT app on my phone. I know that I’m using it.\n\nBut I think what we’re going to see as time goes on is that AI will become more and more embedded in more and more things that we do and use every day. It’s going to be in our cars. It’s going to be on our phones. It will be how we consume entertainment, education, what have you.\n\nMy belief—and, I think, the way Gloo would look at this—is that we see both an opportunity and a responsibility, not just for pastors but for all people of faith. It’s a renewed call for discernment, right?\n\nI think that maybe an effort to stop young people from using AI tools could be workable for some period of time. But what’s probably more likely and admittedly more nuanced is that we need to teach them how to responsibly use those tools for good.\n\nWith my own children, we have conversations about what they’re learning, what answers they’re getting back from AI, and how those answers square with what they know to be true. Because we’ve talked about biblical truth. We’ve talked about principles outside what they’re encountering in those tools. There’s an opportunity for pastors, parents, and educators to equip and arm people to have a truth detector and to understand that when you get answers back from AI, you don’t have to accept those outright. You should question and be curious.\n\nHopefully that kind of discernment is something we’ve always had, but the stakes are higher now with these tools. They speak realistically, and they give us answers that sound right, but that information requires more inspection sometimes.\n\nI share that hope as well—that we will be able to develop that kind of discernment. I do wonder, though, what it communicates if on the one hand we’re saying, “Hold these tools at an arm’s length. Test what you’re hearing against the truth,” but then on the other hand, when I come to my church’s website, it has an AI chatbot. That’s my church, so why would I doubt it? Isn’t that a confusing message? “Be circumspect about AI and chatbots,” but also “Here’s our chatbot. It’s good.”\n\nThat’s a great point. And I think you’re really getting to matters, ultimately, of trust. We should be able to trust our religious institutions or houses of faith, and they historically have been a place where trust is held in high esteem. It can also be quickly broken.\n\nAI tools give churches now a tremendous ability. A small church using AI can create content and repurpose content in forms and languages that would’ve been out of reach only three or five years ago. A small church of 50 people could now have a Spanish-speaking ministry if they chose. That’s a wonderful thing.\n\nBut to your point, if that church is choosing to use tools that are exposed to the congregation, I would agree there’s a responsibility for the church to know that tool _is_ in fact trustworthy and _does_ adhere to the values that the church espouses. That does create a higher burden—a higher bar, if you will—for church leaders before they put a tool out there. They need to ensure that’s an invitation to test, to explore, to be curious, to try to break the tool and make sure it’s going to answer the way the pastor would answer. Otherwise, maybe it’s not ready to go out.\n\n- [More from  Bonnie Kristian](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/bonnie-kristian/)\n\n- Gift This Article\n- ## Share\n\n\nShare\n\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2F2025%2F05%2Fgloo-ai-artificial-intelligence-church-worship-tech-ethics%2F)\n- [X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2F2025%2F05%2Fgloo-ai-artificial-intelligence-church-worship-tech-ethics%2F)\n- [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2F2025%2F05%2Fgloo-ai-artificial-intelligence-church-worship-tech-ethics%2F)\n- [Telegram](https://t.me/share/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2F2025%2F05%2Fgloo-ai-artificial-intelligence-church-worship-tech-ethics%2F)\n- [Email](mailto://www.christianitytoday.com?to=&subject=Christianity Today: Should We Bring AI into the Church?&body=https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/gloo-ai-artificial-intelligence-church-worship-tech-ethics/?utm_medium=widgetemail)\n- Copy Link\n- Gift Article\n\n## Related\n\n### [Blessed Are the Rich, for They Can Afford to Limit Their Kids’ Screen Time](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2023/10/kids-screens-tech-social-media-economic-privilege-parenting/)\n\n[Bonnie Kristian](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/bonnie-kristian/)\n\n### [Do Not Conform to the Work Habits of AI](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2023/09/ai-do-not-conform-work-habits-robots/)\n\n[Bonnie Kristian](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/bonnie-kristian/)\n\n### [The Christian Schools That Cried Wolf](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/christian-schools-cried-wolf/)\n\n[Bonnie Kristian](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/bonnie-kristian/)\n\n- [Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://www.christianitytoday.com/topics/artificial-intelligence-ai/)\n- [Bonnie Kristian](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/bonnie-kristian/)\n- [Church](https://www.christianitytoday.com/topics/church/)\n- [Ethics](https://www.christianitytoday.com/topics/ethics/)\n- [Technology](https://www.christianitytoday.com/topics/technology/)\n- [Worship](https://www.christianitytoday.com/topics/worship/)\n\n## Our Latest\n\n[View All](https://www.christianitytoday.com/our-latest/)\n\nBeing Human\n\n## [Anxiety, the Nervous System, and Your Window of Tolerance: A Conversation with Lisa Cuss & Clarissa Moll](https://www.christianitytoday.com/podcasts/being-human/anxiety-the-nervous-system-and-your-window-of-tolerance-a-conversation-with-lisa-cuss-clarissa-moll/)\n\nHow your nervous system helps you notice God\n\n## [Blaming Women Harms Us All](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/12/blaming-women-harms-us-all/)\n\nDorothy Littell Greco\n\nWhen we fail to protect and honor women like Jesus, we all lose.\n\n## [Synthetic Love Will Tear Us Apart](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/12/synthetic-love-will-tear-us-apart/)\n\n[Chris Poblete](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/chris-poblete/)\n\nWhen we outsource intimacy to machines, we become what we practice.

Used with permission.\n\nBrydon Eastman was wrestling with an ethical quandary. As an applied mathematician at OpenAI, he debated what to do: Keep quiet and protect his job, or speak up and risk losing his position at a company on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence technology.\n\nEastman, 33, started his job with OpenAI in 2022, a few weeks before its famous chatbot ChatGPT debuted. The San Francisco office where Eastman worked had nap rooms, one way the company—like many others in Silicon Valley—encouraged employees to put in long hours. Those hours had gotten longer since Eastman took the job and ChatGPT rocketed to popularity and influence.\n\nFeeling overwhelmed by his dilemma, Eastman went into a nap room and shut off the lights. He prayed for an hour and a half. By the end of that time, he said, he felt clarity from God: The issue was worth confronting. He posted his thoughts on his workplace communication platform, Slack, for the entire company to see. He worried about getting fired, thinking, _This will probably cost me my equity. This will probably cost me a lot of money. But this is the right move._\n\n## Sign up for The Daily Briefing\n\nGet the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nEmail\\*\nSign Up\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) apply.\n\nThanks for signing up.\n\nExplore more newsletters—don’t forget to start your free 60-day trial of CT to get full access to all articles in every newsletter.\n\nSorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nLooking back, he said, “This is following Jesus.” The confrontation “caused some people to change some decisions,” he said. “In the end it turned out okay.” Eastman recently left OpenAI to start a new company, Thinking Machines, which lets him work on projects with which he finds himself more “philosophically aligned.”\n\nAny job can present ethical quandaries, but young Christian engineers working on AI are in the center of an unprecedented surge of technological innovation that is altering the way computers and humans interact. AI developments have also caused a rapid acceleration of tech investment—a “gold rush,” as one investment analyst [put it](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-04-02/openai-raised-the-largest-fundraising-round-ever-whats-next).\n\nIn interviews with CT, engineers in their 20s and 30s shared how they are finding themselves carried along in a surging current of AI advancements, struggling to grab at branches to anchor themselves.\n\nThey plan mathematical experiments, hunch over computers writing code, manage “data labelers”—people who annotate and categorize data used by AI models—and react in real time to the exploding amounts of new research. In crafting machines that reduce work for other humans, these engineers work longer and longer hours and often don’t feel they have time to pray through major issues that pop up. They also say they lack Christian mentors to help them navigate the rushing waters of AI.\n\nThe industry has ballooned since ChatGPT debuted. Nvidia, a chip maker used by AI companies, saw its valuation skyrocket to $3 trillion last year, making it one of the largest companies in the world. Then Chinese newcomer DeepSeek shook up the market in early 2025 when it unveiled a model that was cheaper and more efficient than those from US tech companies like OpenAI.\n\nAs the AI current flows ever faster, engineers often feel powerless to slow it down. “Even if I was 100 percent convinced \\[that\\] as a species we shouldn’t develop AI, as an individual there’s no way I could stop it,” Eastman said. “We’ve been building toward this invention for hundreds of years.”\n\nIn the past, many technological developments progressed slowly enough for humans to cultivate discernment about them, said Mike Langford, a theologian at Seattle Pacific University who studies the intersection of theology and tech. But AI innovation “has happened so quickly that we haven’t had time to develop wisdom about how we use it.”\n\nIn this newest leap of technology, Christian AI engineers could build good, ethical tools that form our lives in ways we don’t yet realize. They’re excellent mathematicians, writers of code, and creative thinkers—and they’ve come to jobs at top tech companies with a moral framework from their faith. They could help companies prioritize data privacy, code equitable algorithms, and treat humans working behind the systems fairly. But they need support. They need guidance. They need rest. There is an air of desperation in Silicon Valley, as engineers compete for a small pool of jobs while continually fearing the next round of layoffs, sources told CT. They worry the AI bubble might burst at any time.\n\nWhen he started working in AI engineering a few years ago, David Kucher, 26, reported he “felt like every minute you had to prove yourself.” He sensed “expectations of more and more and more.”\n\nEastman didn’t join the industry to get in on the AI gold rush. He started his career by researching how AI mathematics could aid cancer treatment. He has great credentials, including a “finite Erdős number” of 3, which means he is three degrees removed from publishing research with mathematician Paul Erdős—a bragging right in the discipline.\n\nBut research wasn’t to be Eastman’s path. Funding for postdoctoral studies fell through, and OpenAI recruited him. He began training machines. A large language model that forms the basis of, say, ChatGPT, takes months to train. Eastman worked in post-training, conducting mathematical experiments to prove the model could do specific tasks.\n\nPost-trainers reinforce and refine the language models with more math and human feedback, telling the model which responses are good or bad and mitigating incoherent, weird, biased, or just bad responses. That means when you ask ChatGPT a question such as “Can you give me a weather forecast for New York written in the style of a Shakespearean sonnet?” it gives a (somewhat) coherent answer.\n\nAs these young Christian AI engineers build powerful tools, they navigate the half jokes from relatives: Are you building something to destroy humanity? Something that will take my job? Something to be greater than God?\n\nFinding companions who understand the unique pressures of working in AI is key. Eastman stays in touch with one Christian mentor: Derek Schuurman, his undergrad computer science professor at Redeemer University in Hamilton, Ontario, where Eastman is from. A background at a small Christian liberal arts college is unusual in AI. Eastman’s education helped him understand that “this tech we’re building isn’t neutral,” he said. “That’s obvious to me, but that’s surprising sometimes to secular engineers or Christian engineers trained in secular institutions…. We’re imbuing particular values in these models.”\n\nIn the absence of Christian friends in AI, Eastman reads Schuurman’s book _[A Christian Field Guide to Technology for Engineers and Designers](https://www.ivpress.com/a-christian-field-guide-to-technology-for-engineers-and-designers)_. Schuurman, now a professor at Calvin University, wrote one chapter as a series of imaginary letters to a young engineer. He warns against ignoring rest, taking too much pride in high-profile projects, putting work ahead of friends and family, and falling into self-reliance from high compensation. Those tendencies don’t appear at the start of a career, he said, but set in insidiously:\n\n> Don’t forget… our entire life is a response to God.… If Christ’s lordship extends over all of life, then his lordship must also extend to engineering and technology. In the words of the late professor [Lewis Smedes](https://www.amazon.com/My-God-I-Spiritual-Memoir/dp/0802870848/tag=christtoday-20), we are called to “go into the world and create some imperfect models of the good world to come.”\n\nFrom The Haunting of Verdant Valley, a photo book by Stephen Voss. Used with permission.\n\nThe engineers who spoke with CT don’t think they’re destroying humanity, but because of the pace of their work, they are navigating their own human limitations as they experience burnout, isolation, and cutthroat company culture. Though they say they don’t feel as though their colleagues are hostile to their faith, they also don’t find many other Christians at their companies.\n\nAffinity groups exist: Google DeepMind engineer Richard Zhang started a collective called Global Christians in AI, with about 250 subscribers. He knows another DeepMind researcher who is hoping to start a Bible study at Google.\n\nBut the average programmer isn’t getting invited to Bible studies at work. Despite headlines about some Silicon Valley executives’ new interest in Christianity, employees on the ground don’t feel like they’re in the middle of some kind of Christian awakening in their offices. They all want to know more Christians in their field but in many cases haven’t found them. One goes on regular runs with his pastor, which helps. Some meet up with other tech professionals at church.\n\nFaith is “still kind of off-limits” in tech companies, and that’s a concern with all the ethical questions around AI, said Hunter Guy, the cofounder and CEO of Study Aloud, an ed tech company. She has mentored industry professionals at Progressive Baptist Church in Chicago. When they disagree with a project or find themselves burned out, Guy said, tech professionals must ask themselves, “When do I walk away?” Part of what will allow Christians to do that, she added, is understanding that “purpose doesn’t end when your job does. Calling doesn’t end when your job does.”\n\nSome Christian AI engineers sense a calling to stay in the field as long as they can. Kenya Andrews is also a member of Progressive Baptist and is friends with Guy. As a Black woman, Andrews is a minority in AI engineering. When she was a little kid, she and her dad built a computer from scratch. When she was a teen, people came to her with their computer questions.\n\nAndrews went on to become the first in her Georgia family to graduate from college. Her parents were the first in their families to graduate high school. Her paternal grandfather was a sharecropper, and her paternal grandmother was a cook and maid. They were adamant that Andrews get as much education as possible.\n\nAndrews, 30, has blown away their expectations: She recently completed a PhD in computer science from the University of Illinois Chicago. But the pressures of doing high-level machine learning research caused her to consider leaving her PhD program to go back to her old software engineering job, which suddenly felt simpler. She kept going because she felt a calling from God. She also didn’t want to let down her family or abandon the research to which she felt she could uniquely contribute.\n\nShe went into AI to research justice in algorithms or, as she puts it, to build machines that treat individual humans as who they truly are. Algorithms are determining everything from employment and parole to health care options and mortgage eligibility. Evidence is piling up that these models are built on historical data with biases against racial minorities. An engineer at a big company may not have time to think about how a seemingly small choice for an algorithmic model will affect millions; a researcher like Andrews, in academia, does.\n\nHer dissertation focused on how algorithms pull data from medical records to make health care decisions. “I think that really aligns well with ‘Love your neighbor as yourself,’ ” she said. “The Word talks about justice a lot… people who didn’t have humanity before, and \\[Jesus\\] now giving them humanity.” She added, “Everything I do is driven by me wanting to honor Christ. It’s not compartmentalized for me.”\n\nBut because of the American political climate, Andrews said it’s been difficult to find support for diversity-related research. She was thinking about applying for a National Institutes of Health grant earlier this year. When she returned to the NIH webpage two weeks later, the grant was no longer listed.\n\nLike Andrews’s family, Michael Shi’s parents are thrilled and proud that he works in AI in Silicon Valley. But for Shi, 31, the job in this cutting-edge field has been all-consuming and stressful. “It has not been a physically, emotionally, spiritually healthy place to be,” he said.\n\nHis own anger in tense moments has surprised him. On one high-profile project, frustration between him and his team escalated, which led to multiple blowups. The project was behind schedule, and he felt that the quality of work was below expectations. Meanwhile, different people on the team were vying for power.\n\nShi said he yelled and made harsh statements to his coworkers. That incident caused him to have doubts about his faith. He wondered why he felt so angry. Shouldn’t God have transformed him more by now? A Christian shouldn’t react that way, he thought.\n\nFrom The Haunting of Verdant Valley, a photo book by Stephen Voss. Used with permission.\n\nHe feels like his church friends can’t really understand what’s going on at his workplace. He doesn’t know other Christians in AI. “I had not been giving much grace to others because I had not given myself space to receive grace from the Lord,” he said. “I’m beginning to realize that the expectations I place on myself or others place on me are not the same as God’s expectations for me. God is ultimately pleased by my faithfulness.”\n\nHe tries to go for walks outside, which clear his mind. He goes to his pastor’s class on spiritual disciplines. But he knows he’s burned out.\n\nOn the other hand, Zhang at Google DeepMind doesn’t want Christian engineers to be so worried about burnout that they stop working hard. “The tension there is we’re called to be excellent,” he said. At another company he knows of, Christians have a reputation for being lazy. “It’s hard to balance.”\n\nA big part of the growing burnout is that the AI boom came shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic, which young engineers said both isolated them and erased their work-life boundaries.\n\nKucher, the AI engineer who entered the field a few years ago, started graduate school weeks before the pandemic set in. He was sitting in a room by himself facing down Zoom classes and math equations on a laptop. Work never stopped, and knowledgeable counsel was hard to come by. Now at a startup, he said, more weeks have become “bad weeks” at work. “The pace of stuff has been absolutely insane.”\n\nLike other Christian engineers, Kucher entered the industry because he wanted to create something that would help people and that they would use every day. Some of his graduate work involved improving medical imaging through machine learning.\n\nHe left one company after feeling disillusioned about its purely profit-driven product. Now he works at a company where he feels like he’s building something better. He’s spent a year and a half programming a chat application that can instantly pull together data analysis that would have taken a human a week to do. But there’s no break in sight for him.\n\n“It hurts to have things I prioritize—like exercise or volunteering at church—slowly, bit by bit, being eroded, depending on the week we’re having at work,” he said. He hasn’t found a Christian mentor in the AI field, despite trying.\n\nKucher reminds himself that his identity is not his job. He fights for time to rest. “I am a child of God,” he tells himself. “I’m valued and I’m worthy, and I’m doing my best.”\n\nEmily Belz is a senior staff writer at Christianity Today.\n\nThis article appeared in the [July/August 2025](https://www.christianitytoday.com/magazine/2025/july-august/) issue of [**Christianity Today**](https://www.christianitytoday.com/magazine/) as \"Faith in the Machine\".\n\n- [More from  Emily Belz](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/emily-belz/)\n\n- Gift This Article\n- ## Share\n\n\nShare\n\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2F2025%2F07%2Fmeet-christian-engineers-helping-shape-ai%2F)\n- [X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2F2025%2F07%2Fmeet-christian-engineers-helping-shape-ai%2F)\n- [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2F2025%2F07%2Fmeet-christian-engineers-helping-shape-ai%2F)\n- [Telegram](https://t.me/share/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianitytoday.com%2F2025%2F07%2Fmeet-christian-engineers-helping-shape-ai%2F)\n- [Email](mailto://www.christianitytoday.com?to=&subject=Christianity Today: Meet the Christian Engineers Helping to Shape AI&body=https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/07/meet-christian-engineers-helping-shape-ai/?utm_medium=widgetemail)\n- Copy Link\n- Gift Article\n\n## Related\n\n### [AI Can Preach and Sing.

In this imagined future, Pastor Joshua sits across the desk from Aiden, a little boy going to the church’s summer outreach program. Aiden wants to know how he can become a Christian. He wants to repent of his sins, put his faith in Jesus, and go to heaven when he dies.\n\n## Sign up for Moore to the Point\n\nJoin Russell Moore in thinking through the important questions of the day, along with book and music recommendations he has found formative.\n\nEmail\\*\nSign Up\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) apply.\n\nThanks for signing up.\n\nExplore more newsletters—don’t forget to start your free 60-day trial of CT to get full access to all articles in every newsletter.\n\nSorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nThe catch: Aiden is manufactured, a Frankenstein’s creation of cloned human body parts with a generative AI mind. The question my students faced was “What would you advise Pastor Joshua to do?” Should he walk Aiden through the answer to the ancient query “What must I do to be saved?” (Acts 16:30). Does the “whosoever” in John 3:16 apply to him—or, should I say, to _it_?\n\nThe point of that final exam was to dislodge students from their tendency to treat ethical dilemmas like a world-view concordance of right answers to premade questions. I wanted to see not so much their answers as how they arrived at their answers—how they integrated the Bible and the gospel into a situation for which they probably didn’t have preexisting slogans.\n\n## related\n\n### [The Real Problem with AI Prayers](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/06/the-real-problem-with-ai-prayers/)\n\nAlastair Roberts\n\n### [Should We Bring AI into the Church?](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/05/gloo-ai-artificial-intelligence-church-worship-tech-ethics/)\n\n[Interview by Bonnie Kristian](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/bonnie-kristian/)\n\nToday, those students are still far from having great-grandchildren, yet here we all are. We’re on the cusp of what some are calling an “ [axial decade](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Future-Rearview-Mirror-Alphabet/dp/1777358914/tag=christtoday-20),” in which advances in artificial intelligence may spur on the contemporary equivalent of the [Axial Age](https://highschool.latimes.com/education/the-axial-age-a-spiritual-revolution/) (when the emergence of literacy transformed the way human beings exist in the world).\n\nPastor Joshua might not be born yet, but Aiden is here. And the church is not ready. Indeed, to talk seriously about AI is to risk causing the same reaction that many of my students had to their final—categorizing it as futuristic science fiction. But the root of our unreadiness is not that we don’t adequately understand what a chatbot is. It’s that we don’t sufficiently understand what a human being is.\n\nThe crisis of our age is a radical reducing of human life to a flow of data and information, so much so that some tech pioneers suggest eternal life can be achieved by [uploading our minds](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/60341/1/mind-uploading-key-to-eternal-life-or-terrifying-dystopia-neuralink-elon-musk) to a digital cloud. Douglas Rushkoff describes this mindset as “the belief that we can code our way out of this mess,” presuming that in a world of code, “anything that isn’t yet code can eventually be converted to a digital format as easily as a vinyl record can be translated to a streaming file.”\n\nChristians, of course, have a distinctive view of the human person as _imago Dei_—made in the image and likeness of God (Gen. 1:27). The problem is that modern Christians often unintentionally speak of this distinctiveness in terms just as machinelike as those used by the world around us.\n\nWe try to identify what “part” of us bears the image. We are morally accountable, we say, unlike other animals—and that’s true, but the Bible tells us there are other morally accountable beings in the universe (1 Cor. 6:3). Or we point to our ability for relationship—and that’s true also, but what does that say when people [fall in love with their chatbots](https://time.com/6257790/ai-chatbots-love/)?\n\nPerhaps most problematically, we speak of the _imago Dei_ as our rationality, our ability to think and to reason. But intelligence has never been exclusive to human beings. The Serpent of Eden is described as “crafty” or “cunning” (Gen. 3:1; 2 Cor. 11:3), and the apostle Paul spoke of the “schemes” of the Devil (Eph. 6:11, ESV throughout).\n\nAfter Genesis, though, the Bible doesn’t further define the concept of the image of God until the New Testament. Even then, it defines that image not as a _what_ or a _how_ but a _who_.\n\nJesus, Paul wrote, is “the image of the invisible God” (Col. 1:15). The Incarnation means that Jesus joined us in flesh and blood, in our suffering and creatureliness, in order to free us from our captivity to the power of death (Heb. 2:14–15).\n\n## recommended\n\n### [AI and All Its Splendors](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/01/ai-splendors-science-fiction-temptation-christ/)\n\n[Jeffrey Bilbro](https://www.christianitytoday.com/writers/jeffrey-bilbro/)\n\n### [We’re Asking the Wrong Tech Question](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/06/wrong-tech-question-artificial-intelligence-ai-church/)\n\nMitchell East\n\nAll creation is meant, somehow, to recognize humanity as signifying the reign of God (Rom. 8:19). And in the flesh-and-blood person of Jesus, it does. Even the molecular structures of fish and bread obey him and multiply. In strikingly personal terms, Jesus says, “Peace! Be still!” to the wind and waves, and they respond (Mark 4:39).\n\nPaul speaks of creation as revealing the “invisible attributes” of God (Rom. 1:20) in ways that mirror the concept of the image of God. This is not the potential to trace philosophical arguments from the order of the world back to God; the Bible says this revelation to humanity is “plain to them, because God has shown it to them” (v. 19). Something in our being is meant to resonate with the awe and mystery of the world, triggering us to recognize something—someone—behind the veil of what we can see.\n\nThe church in the AI age must recognize that to be human is not about “stuff” that can be weighed or quantified. We must understand that there’s a mystery to life that cannot be uploaded or downloaded or manipulated by technique. Simply recognizing this in an age of smart machines is a good start.\n\nThe world has always asked what the meaning of human life is. It is about to start asking what it means to be human at all.

With wisdom both ancient and new (cf. Mt. 13:52), we are called to reflect on the current challenges and opportunities posed by scientific and technological advancements, particularly by the recent development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The Christian tradition regards the gift of intelligence as an essential aspect of how humans are created &#8220;&#8220;in the image of God&#8221;&#8221; (Gen. 1:27). Starting from an integral vision of the human person and the biblical calling to &#8220;&#8220;till&#8221;&#8221; and &#8220;&#8220;keep&#8221;&#8221; the earth (Gen. 2:15), the Church emphasizes that this gift of intelligence should be expressed through the responsible use of reason and technical abilities in the stewardship of the created world.\n2. The Church encourages the advancement of science, technology, the arts, and other forms of human endeavor, viewing them as part of the &#8220;collaboration of man and woman with God in perfecting the visible creation.&#8221;[[1]](#_ftn1)As Sirach affirms, God &#8220;gave skill to human beings, that he might be glorified in his marvelous works&#8221; (Sir. 38:6). Human abilities and creativity come from God and, when used rightly, glorify God by reflecting his wisdom and goodness. In light of this, when we ask ourselves what it means to &#8220;be human,&#8221; we cannot exclude a consideration of our scientific and technological abilities.\n3. It is within this perspective that the present*Note*addresses the anthropological and ethical challenges raised by AI&#8212;issues that are particularly significant, as one of the goals of this technology is*to imitate the human intelligence that designed it.*For instance, unlike many other human creations, AI can be trained on the results of human creativity and then generate new &#8220;artifacts&#8221; with a level of speed and skill that often rivals or surpasses what humans can do, such as producing text or images indistinguishable from human compositions. This raises critical concerns about AI&#8217;s potential role in the growing crisis of truth in the public forum. Moreover, this technology is designed to learn and make certain choices autonomously, adapting to new situations and providing solutions not foreseen by its programmers, and thus, it raises fundamental questions about ethical responsibility and human safety, with broader implications for society as a whole. This new situation has prompted many people to reflect on what it means to be human and the role of humanity in the world.\n4. Taking all this into account, there is broad consensus that AI marks a new and significant phase in humanity&#8217;s engagement with technology, placing it at the heart of what Pope Francis has described as an &#8220;epochal change.&#8221;[[2]](#_ftn2)Its impact is felt globally and in a wide range of areas, including interpersonal relationships, education, work, art, healthcare, law, warfare, and international relations. As AI advances rapidly toward even greater achievements, it is critically important to consider its anthropological and ethical implications. This involves not only mitigating risks and preventing harm but also ensuring that its applications are used to promote human progress and the common good.\n5. To contribute positively to the discernment regarding AI, and in response to Pope Francis&#8217; call for a renewed &#8220;wisdom of heart,&#8221;[[3]](#_ftn3)the Church offers its experience through the anthropological and ethical reflections contained in this*Note*. Committed to its active role in the global dialogue on these issues, the Church invites those entrusted with transmitting the faith&#8212;including parents, teachers, pastors, and bishops&#8212;to dedicate themselves to this critical subject with care and attention. While this document is intended especially for them, it is also meant to be accessible to a broader audience, particularly those who share the conviction that scientific and technological advances should be directed toward serving the human person and the common good.[[4]](#_ftn4)\n6. To this end, the document begins by distinguishing between concepts of intelligence in AI and in human intelligence. It then explores the Christian understanding of human intelligence, providing a framework rooted in the Church&#8217;s philosophical and theological tradition. Finally, the document offers guidelines to ensure that the development and use of AI uphold human dignity and promote the integral development of the human person and society.\nII.**What is Artificial Intelligence?**\n7. The concept of &#8220;intelligence&#8221; in AI has evolved over time, drawing on a range of ideas from various disciplines. While its origins extend back centuries, a significant milestone occurred in 1956 when the American computer scientist John McCarthy organized a summer workshop at Dartmouth University to explore the problem of &#8220;Artificial Intelligence,&#8221; which he defined as &#8220;that of making a machine behave in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving.&#8221;[[5]](#_ftn5)This workshop launched a research program focused on designing machines capable of performing tasks typically associated with the human intellect and intelligent behavior.\n8. Since then, AI research has advanced rapidly, leading to the development of complex systems capable of performing highly sophisticated tasks.[[6]](#_ftn6)These so-called &#8220;narrow AI&#8221; systems are typically designed to handle specific and limited functions, such as translating languages, predicting the trajectory of a storm, classifying images, answering questions, or generating visual content at the user&#8217;s request. While the definition of &#8220;intelligence&#8221; in AI research varies, most contemporary AI systems&#8212;particularly those using machine learning&#8212;rely on statistical inference rather than logical deduction. By analyzing large datasets to identify patterns, AI can &#8220;predict&#8221;[[7]](#_ftn7)outcomes and propose new approaches, mimicking some cognitive processes typical of human problem-solving. Such achievements have been made possible through advances in computing technology (including neural networks, unsupervised machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms) as well as hardware innovations (such as specialized processors). Together, these technologies enable AI systems to respond to various forms of human input, adapt to new situations, and even suggest novel solutions not anticipated by their original programmers.[[8]](#_ftn8)\n9. Due to these rapid advancements, many tasks once managed exclusively by humans are now entrusted to AI. These systems can augment or even supersede what humans are able to do in many fields, particularly in specialized areas such as data analysis, image recognition, and medical diagnosis. While each &#8220;narrow AI&#8221; application is designed for a specific task, many researchers aspire to develop what is known as &#8220;Artificial General Intelligence&#8221; (AGI)&#8212;a single system capable of operating across all cognitive domains and performing any task within the scope of human intelligence. Some even argue that AGI could one day achieve the state of &#8220;superintelligence,&#8221; surpassing human intellectual capacities, or contribute to &#8220;super-longevity&#8221; through advances in biotechnology. Others, however, fear that these possibilities, even if hypothetical, could one day eclipse the human person, while still others welcome this potential transformation.[[9]](#_ftn9)\n10. Underlying this and many other perspectives on the subject is the implicit assumption that the term &#8220;intelligence&#8221; can be used in the same way to refer to both human intelligence and AI. Yet, this does not capture the full scope of the concept. In the case of humans, intelligence is a faculty that pertains to the person in his or her entirety, whereas in the context of AI, &#8220;intelligence&#8221; is understood functionally, often with the presumption that the activities characteristic of the human mind can be broken down into digitized steps that machines can replicate.[[10]](#_ftn10)\n11. This functional perspective is exemplified by the &#8220;Turing Test,&#8221; which considers a machine &#8220;intelligent&#8221; if a person cannot distinguish its behavior from that of a human.[[11]](#_ftn11)However, in this context, the term &#8220;behavior&#8221; refers only to the performance of specific intellectual tasks; it does not account for the full breadth of human experience, which includes abstraction, emotions, creativity, and the aesthetic, moral, and religious sensibilities. Nor does it encompass the full range of expressions characteristic of the human mind. Instead, in the case of AI, the &#8220;intelligence&#8221; of a system is evaluated methodologically, but also reductively, based on its*ability to produce appropriate responses&#8212;in this case, those associated with the human intellect&#8212;regardless of how those responses are generated*.\n12. AI&#8217;s advanced features give it sophisticated abilities to*perform tasks*, but not the ability to*think*.[[12]](#_ftn12)This distinction is crucially important, as the way &#8220;intelligence&#8221; is defined inevitably shapes how we understand the relationship between human thought and this technology.[[13]](#_ftn13)To appreciate this, one must recall the richness of the philosophical tradition and Christian theology, which offer a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of intelligence&#8212;an understanding that is central to the Church&#8217;s teaching on the nature, dignity, and vocation of the human person.[[14]](#_ftn14)\nIII.**Intelligence in the Philosophicaland Theological Tradition**\n*Rationality*\n13. From the dawn of human self-reflection, the mind has played a central role in understanding what it means to be &#8220;human.&#8221; Aristotle observed that &#8220;all people by nature desire to know.&#8221;[[15]](#_ftn15)This knowledge, with its capacity for abstraction that grasps the nature and meaning of things, sets humans apart from the animal world.[[16]](#_ftn16)As philosophers, theologians, and psychologists have examined the exact nature of this intellectual faculty, they have also explored how humans understand the world and their unique place within it. Through this exploration, the Christian tradition has come to understand the human person as a being consisting of both body and soul&#8212;deeply connected to this world and yet transcending it.[[17]](#_ftn17)\n14. In the classical tradition, the concept of intelligence is often understood through the complementary concepts of &#8220;reason&#8221; (*ratio*) and &#8220;intellect&#8221; (*intellectus*). These are not separate faculties but, as Saint Thomas Aquinas explains, they are two modes in which the same intelligence operates: &#8220;The term*intellect*is inferred from the inward grasp of the truth, while the name*reason*is taken from the inquisitive and discursive process.&#8221;[[18]](#_ftn18)This concise description highlights the two fundamental and complementary dimensions of human intelligence.*Intellectus*refers to the intuitive grasp of the truth&#8212;that is, apprehending it with the &#8220;eyes&#8221; of the mind&#8212;which precedes and grounds argumentation itself.*Ratio*pertains to reasoning proper: the discursive, analytical process that leads to judgment. Together, intellect and reason form the two facets of the act of*intelligere*, &#8220;the proper operation of the human being as such.&#8221;[[19]](#_ftn19)\n15. Describing the human person as a &#8220;rational&#8221; being does not reduce the person to a specific mode of thought; rather, it recognizes that the ability for intellectual understanding shapes and permeates all aspects of human activity.[[20]](#_ftn20)Whether exercised well or poorly, this capacity is an intrinsic aspect of human nature. In this sense, the &#8220;term &#8216;rational&#8217; encompasses all the capacities of the human person,&#8221; including those related to &#8220;knowing and understanding, as well as those of willing, loving, choosing, and desiring; it also includes all corporeal functions closely related to these abilities.&#8221;[[21]](#_ftn21)This comprehensive perspective underscores how, in the human person, created in the &#8220;&#8220;image of God,&#8221;&#8221; reason is integrated in a way that elevates, shapes, and transforms both the person&#8217;&#8217;s will and actions.[[22]](#_ftn22)\n*Embodiment*\n16. Christian thought considers the intellectual faculties of the human person within the framework of an integral anthropology that views the human being as essentially embodied. In the human person, spirit and matter &#8220;are not two natures united, but rather their union forms a single nature.&#8221;[[23]](#_ftn23)In other words, the soul is not merely the immaterial &#8220;&#8220;part&#8221;&#8221; of the person contained within the body, nor is the body an outer shell housing an intangible &#8220;&#8220;core.&#8221;&#8221; Rather, the entire human person is simultaneously both material and spiritual. This understanding reflects the teaching of Sacred Scripture, which views the human person as a being who lives out relationships with God and others (and thus, an authentically spiritual dimension) within and through this embodied existence.[[24]](#_ftn24)The profound meaning of this condition is further illuminated by the mystery of the Incarnation, through which God himself took on our flesh and &#8220;&#8220;raised it up to a sublime dignity.&#8221;&#8221;[[25]](#_ftn25)\n17. Although deeply rooted in bodily existence, the human person transcends the material world through the soul, which is &#8220;almost on the horizon of eternity and time.&#8221;[[26]](#_ftn26)The intellect&#39;&#39;s capacity for transcendence and the self-possessed freedom of the will belong to the soul, by which the human person &#8220;&#8220;shares in the light of the divine mind.&#8221;&#8221;[[27]](#_ftn27)Nevertheless, the human spirit does not exercise its normal mode of knowledge without the body.[[28]](#_ftn28)In this way, the intellectual faculties of the human person are an integral part of an anthropology that recognizes that the human person is a &#8220;&#8220;unity of body and soul.&#8221;&#8221;[[29]](#_ftn29)Further aspects of this understanding will be developed in what follows.\n*Relationality*\n18. Human beings are &#8220;&#8220;ordered by their very nature to interpersonal communion,&#8221;&#8221;[[30]](#_ftn30)possessing the capacity to know one another, to give themselves in love, and to enter into communion with others. Accordingly, human intelligence is not an isolated faculty but is exercised in relationships, finding its fullest expression in dialogue, collaboration, and solidarity. We learn with others, and we learn through others.\n19. The relational orientation of the human person is ultimately grounded in the eternal self-giving of the Triune God, whose love is revealed in creation and redemption.[[31]](#_ftn31)The human person is &#8220;&#8220;called to share, by knowledge and love, in God&#8217;&#8217;s own life.&#8221;&#8221;[[32]](#_ftn32)\n20. This vocation to communion with God is necessarily tied to the call to communion with others. Love of God cannot be separated from love for one&#8217;&#8217;s neighbor (cf. 1 Jn. 4:20; Mt. 22:37-39). By the grace of sharing God&#8217;&#8217;s life, Christians are also called to imitate Christ&#8217;&#8217;s outpouring gift (cf. 2 Cor. 9:8-11; Eph. 5:1-2) by following his command to &#8220;&#8220;love one another, as I have loved you&#8221;&#8221; (Jn.13:34).[[33]](#_ftn33)Love and service, echoing the divine life of self-giving, transcend self-interest to respond more fully to the human vocation (cf. 1 Jn. 2:9). Even more sublime than knowing many things is the commitment to care for one another, for if &#8220;&#8220;I understand all mysteries and all knowledge [...] but do not have love, I am nothing&#8221;&#8221; (1 Cor. 13:2).\n*Relationship with the Truth*\n21. Human intelligence is ultimately &#8220;God&#8217;s gift fashioned for the assimilation of truth.&#8221;[[34]](#_ftn34)In the dual sense of*intellectus*-*ratio*, it enables the person to explore realities that surpass mere sensory experience or utility, since &#8220;the desire for truth is part of human nature itself. It is an innate property of human reason to ask why things are as they are.&#8221;[[35]](#_ftn35)Moving beyond the limits of empirical data, human intelligence can &#8220;&#8220;with genuine certitude attain to reality itself as knowable.&#8221;&#8221;[[36]](#_ftn36)While reality remains only partially known, the desire for truth &#8220;&#8220;spurs reason always to go further; indeed, it is as if reason were overwhelmed to see that it can always go beyond what it has already achieved.&#8221;&#8221;[[37]](#_ftn37)Although Truth in itself transcends the boundaries of human intelligence, it irresistibly attracts it.[[38]](#_ftn38)Drawn by this attraction, the human person is led to seek &#8220;&#8220;truths of a higher order.&#8221;&#8221;[[39]](#_ftn39)\n22. This innate drive toward the pursuit of truth is especially evident in the distinctly human capacities for semantic understanding and creativity,[[40]](#_ftn40)through which this search unfolds in a &#8220;&#8220;manner that is appropriate to the social nature and dignity of the human person.&#8221;&#8221;[[41]](#_ftn41)Likewise, a steadfast orientation to the truth is essential for charity to be both authentic and universal.[[42]](#_ftn42)\n23. The search for truth finds its highest expression in openness to realities that transcend the physical and created world. In God, all truths attain their ultimate and original meaning.[[43]](#_ftn43)Entrusting oneself to God is a &#8220;&#8220;fundamental decision that engages the whole person.&#8221;&#8221;[[44]](#_ftn44)In this way, the human person becomes fully what he or she is called to be: &#8220;the intellect and the will display their spiritual nature,&#8221; enabling the person &#8220;to act in a way that realizes personal freedom to the full.&#8221;[[45]](#_ftn45)\n*Stewardship of the World*\n24. The Christian faith understands creation as the free act of the Triune God, who, as Saint Bonaventure of Bagnoregio explains, creates &#8220;not to increase his glory, but to show it forth and to communicate it.&#8221;[[46]](#_ftn46)Since God creates according to his Wisdom (cf. Wis. 9:9; Jer. 10:12), creation is imbued with an intrinsic order that reflects God&#8217;&#8217;s plan (cf. Gen. 1; Dan. 2:21-22; Is. 45:18; Ps. 74:12-17; 104),[[47]](#_ftn47)within which God has called human beings to assume a unique role:*to**cultivate and care for the world*.[[48]](#_ftn48)\n25. Shaped by the Divine Craftsman, humans live out their identity as beings made*in imago Dei*by &#8220;keeping&#8221; and &#8220;tilling&#8221; (cf. Gen. 2:15) creation&#8212;using their intelligence and skills to care for and develop creation in accord with God&#8217;s plan.[[49]](#_ftn49)In this, human intelligence reflects the Divine Intelligence that created all things (cf. Gen. 1-2; Jn. 1),[[50]](#_ftn50)continuously sustains them, and guides them to their ultimate purpose in him.[[51]](#_ftn51)Moreover, human beings are called to develop their abilities in science and technology, for through them, God is glorified (cf*.*Sir.**38:6). Thus, in a proper relationship with creation, humans, on the one hand, use their intelligence and skill to cooperate with God in guiding creation toward the purpose to which he has called it.[[52]](#_ftn52)On the other hand, creation itself, as Saint Bonaventure observes, helps the human mind to &#8220;ascend gradually to the supreme Principle, who is God.&#8221;[[53]](#_ftn53)\n*An IntegralUnderstanding of Human Intelligence*\n26. In this context, human intelligence becomes more clearly understood as a faculty that forms an integral part of how the whole person engages with reality. Authentic engagement requires embracing the full scope of one&#8217;s being: spiritual, cognitive, embodied, and relational.\n27. This engagement with reality unfolds in various ways, as each person, in his or her multifaceted individuality[[54]](#_ftn54), seeks to understand the world, relate to others, solve problems, express creativity, and pursue integral well-being through the harmonious interplay of the various dimensions of the person&#8217;s intelligence.[[55]](#_ftn55)This involves logical and linguistic abilities but can also encompass other modes of interacting with reality. Consider the work of an artisan, who &#8220;&#8220;must know how to discern, in inert matter, a particular form that others cannot recognize&#8221;&#8221;[[56]](#_ftn56)and bring it forth through insight and practical skill. Indigenous peoples who live close to the earth often possess a profound sense of nature and its cycles.[[57]](#_ftn57)Similarly, a friend who knows the right word to say or a person adept at managing human relationships exemplifies an intelligence that is &#8220;&#8220;the fruit of self-examination, dialogue and generous encounter between persons.&#8221;&#8221;[[58]](#_ftn58)As Pope Francis observes, &#8220;&#8220;in this age of artificial intelligence, we cannot forget that poetry and love are necessary to save our humanity.&#8221;&#8221;[[59]](#_ftn59)\n28. At the heart of the Christian understanding of intelligence is the integration of truth into the moral and spiritual life of the person, guiding his or her actions in light of God&#8217;s goodness and truth. According to God&#8217;s plan, intelligence, in its fullest sense, also includes the ability to savor what is true, good, and beautiful. As the twentieth-century French poet Paul Claudel expressed, &#8220;intelligence is nothing without delight.&#8221;[[60]](#_ftn60)Similarly, Dante, upon reaching the highest heaven in*Paradiso*, testifies that the culmination of this intellectual delight is found in the &#8220;light intellectual full of love, love of true good filled with joy, joy which transcends every sweetness.&#8221;[[61]](#_ftn61)\n29. A proper understanding of human intelligence, therefore, cannot be reduced to the mere acquisition of facts or the ability to perform specific tasks. Instead, it involves the person&#8217;s openness to the ultimate questions of life and reflects an orientation toward the True and the Good.[[62]](#_ftn62)As an expression of the divine image within the person, human intelligence has the ability to access the totality of being, contemplating existence in its fullness, which goes beyond what is measurable, and grasping the meaning of what has been understood. For believers, this capacity includes, in a particular way, the ability to grow in the knowledge of the mysteries of God by using reason to engage ever more profoundly with revealed truths (*intellectus fidei*).[[63]](#_ftn63)True intelligence is shaped by divine love, which &#8220;&#8220;is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Spirit&#8221;&#8221; (Rom. 5:5). From this, it follows that human intelligence possesses an essential*contemplative*dimension, an unselfish openness to the True, the Good, and the Beautiful, beyond any utilitarian purpose.\n*The Limits of AI*\n30. In light of the foregoing discussion, the differences between human intelligence and current AI systems become evident. While AI is an extraordinary technological achievement capable of imitating certain outputs associated with human intelligence, it operates by performing tasks, achieving goals, or making decisions based on quantitative data and computational logic. For example, with its analytical power, AI excels at integrating data from a variety of fields, modeling complex systems, and fostering interdisciplinary connections. In this way, it can help experts collaborate in solving complex problems that &#8220;cannot be dealt with from a single perspective or from a single set of interests.&#8221;[[64]](#_ftn64)\n31. However, even as AI processes and simulates certain expressions of intelligence, it remains fundamentally confined to a logical-mathematical framework, which imposes inherent limitations. Human intelligence, in contrast, develops organically throughout the person&#8217;s physical and psychological growth, shaped by a myriad of lived experiences in the flesh. Although advanced AI systems can &#8220;learn&#8221; through processes such as machine learning, this sort of training is fundamentally different from the developmental growth of human intelligence, which is shaped by embodied experiences, including sensory input, emotional responses, social interactions, and the unique context of each moment. These elements shape and form individuals within their personal history.****In contrast, AI, lacking a physical body, relies on computational reasoning and learning based on vast datasets that include recorded human experiences and knowledge.\n32. Consequently, although AI can simulate aspects of human reasoning and perform specific tasks with incredible speed and efficiency, its computational abilities represent only a fraction of the broader capacities of the human mind. For instance, AI cannot currently replicate moral discernment or the ability to establish authentic relationships. Moreover, human intelligence is situated within a personally lived history of intellectual and moral formation that fundamentally shapes the individual&#8217;s perspective, encompassing the physical, emotional, social, moral, and spiritual dimensions of life. Since AI cannot offer this fullness of understanding, approaches that rely solely on this technology or treat it as the primary means of interpreting the world can lead to &#8220;a loss of appreciation for the whole, for the relationships between things, and for the broader horizon.&#8221;[[65]](#_ftn65)\n33. Human intelligence is not primarily about completing functional tasks but about understanding and actively engaging with reality in all its dimensions; it is also capable of surprising insights. Since AI lacks the richness of corporeality, relationality, and the openness of the human heart to truth and goodness, its capacities&#8212;though seemingly limitless&#8212;are incomparable with the human ability to grasp reality. So much can be learned from an illness, an embrace of reconciliation, and even a simple sunset; indeed, many experiences we have as humans open new horizons and offer the possibility of attaining new wisdom. No device, working solely with data, can measure up to these and countless other experiences present in our lives.\n34. Drawing an overly close equivalence between human intelligence and AI risks succumbing to a functionalist perspective, where people are valued based on the work they can perform. However, a person&#8217;s worth does not depend on possessing specific skills, cognitive and technological achievements, or individual success, but on the person&#8217;s inherent dignity, grounded in being created in the image of God.[[66]](#_ftn66)This dignity remains intact in all circumstances, including for those unable to exercise their abilities, whether it be an unborn child, an unconscious person, or an older person who is suffering.[[67]](#_ftn67)It also underpins the tradition of human rights (and, in particular, what are now called &#8220;&#8220;neuro-rights&#8221;&#8221;), which represent &#8220;&#8220;an important point of convergence in the search for common ground&#8221;&#8221;[[68]](#_ftn68)and can, thus, serve as a fundamental ethical guide in discussions on the responsible development and use of AI.\n35. Considering all these points, as Pope Francis observes, &#8220;the very use of the word &#8216;intelligence&#8217;&#8221; in connection with AI &#8220;can prove misleading&#8221;[[69]](#_ftn69)and risks overlooking what is most precious in the human person. In light of this, AI should not be seen as*an artificial form*of**human intelligence but as*a product*of**it.[[70]](#_ftn70)\nIV.**The Role of Ethicsin Guiding the Development and Use of AI**\n36. Given these considerations, one can ask how AI can be understood within God&#8217;s plan. To answer this, it is important to recall that techno-scientific activity is not neutral in character but is a*human*endeavor that engages the humanistic and cultural dimensions of human creativity.[[71]](#_ftn71)\n37. Seen as a fruit of the potential inscribed within human intelligence,[[72]](#_ftn72)scientific inquiry and the development of technical skills are part of the &#8220;&#8220;collaboration of man and woman with God in perfecting the visible creation.&#8221;&#8221;[[73]](#_ftn73)At the same time, all scientific and technological achievements are, ultimately, gifts from God.[[74]](#_ftn74)Therefore, human beings must always use their abilities in view of the higher purpose for which God has granted them.[[75]](#_ftn75)\n38. We can gratefully acknowledge how technology has &#8220;remedied countless evils which used to harm and limit human beings,&#8221;[[76]](#_ftn76)a fact for which we should rejoice. Nevertheless, not all technological advancements in themselves represent genuine human progress.[[77]](#_ftn77)The Church is particularly opposed to those applications that threaten the sanctity of life or the dignity of the human person.[[78]](#_ftn78)Like any human endeavor, technological development must be directed to serve the human person and contribute to the pursuit of &#8220;&#8220;greater justice, more extensive fraternity, and a more humane order of social relations,&#8221;&#8221; which are &#8220;&#8220;more valuable than advances in the technical field.&#8221;&#8221;[[79]](#_ftn79)Concerns about the ethical implications of technological development are shared not only within the Church but also among many scientists, technologists, and professional associations, who increasingly call for ethical reflection to guide this development in a responsible way.\n39. To address these challenges, it is essential to emphasize*the importance of moral responsibility grounded in the dignity and vocation of the human person*. This guiding principle also applies to questions concerning AI. In this context, the ethical dimension takes on primary importance because it is people who design systems and determine the purposes for which they are used.[[80]](#_ftn80)Between a machine and a human being, only the latter is truly a moral agent&#8212;&#8212;a subject of moral responsibility who exercises freedom in his or her decisions and accepts their consequences.[[81]](#_ftn81)It is not the machine but the human who is in relationship with truth and goodness, guided by a moral conscience that calls the person &#8220;&#8220;to love and to do what is good and to avoid evil,&#8221;&#8221;[[82]](#_ftn82)bearing witness to &#8220;&#8220;the authority of truth in reference to the supreme Good to which the human person is drawn.&#8221;&#8221;[[83]](#_ftn83)Likewise, between a machine and a human, only the human can be sufficiently self-aware to the point of listening and following the voice of conscience, discerning with prudence, and seeking the good that is possible in every situation.[[84]](#_ftn84)In fact, all of this also belongs to the person&#8217;&#8217;s exercise of intelligence.\n40. Like any product of human creativity, AI can be directed toward positive or negative ends.[[85]](#_ftn85)When used in ways that respect human dignity and promote the well-being of individuals and communities, it can contribute positively to the human vocation. Yet, as in all areas where humans are called to make decisions, the shadow of evil also looms here. Where human freedom allows for the possibility of choosing what is wrong, the moral evaluation of this technology will need to take into account how it is directed and used.\n41. At the same time, it is not only the ends that are ethically significant but also the means employed to achieve them. Additionally, the overall vision and understanding of the human person embedded within these systems are important to consider as well. Technological products reflect the worldview of their developers, owners, users, and regulators,[[86]](#_ftn86)and have the power to &#8220;&#8220;shape the world and engage consciences on the level of values.&#8221;&#8221;[[87]](#_ftn87)On a societal level, some technological developments could also reinforce relationships and power dynamics that are inconsistent with a proper understanding of the human person and society.\n42. Therefore, the ends and the means used in a given application of AI, as well as the overall vision it incorporates, must all be evaluated to ensure they respect human dignity and promote the common good.[[88]](#_ftn88)As Pope Francis has stated, &#8220;&#8220;the intrinsic dignity of every man and every woman&#8221;&#8221; must be &#8220;&#8220;the key criterion in evaluating emerging technologies; these will prove ethically sound to the extent that they help respect that dignity and increase its expression at every level of human life,&#8221;&#8221;[[89]](#_ftn89)including in the social and economic spheres. In this sense, human intelligence plays a crucial role not only in designing and producing technology but also in directing its use in line with the authentic good of the human person.[[90]](#_ftn90)The responsibility for managing this wisely pertains to every level of society, guided by the principle of subsidiarity and other principles of Catholic Social Teaching.\n*Helping HumanFreedom and Decision-Making*\n43. The commitment to ensuring that*AI always supports and promotes the supreme value of the dignity of every human being and the fullness of the human vocation*serves as a criterion of discernment for developers, owners, operators, and regulators of AI, as well as to its users. It remains valid for every application of the technology at every level of its use.\n44. An evaluation of the implications of this guiding principle could begin by considering the importance of*moral responsibility.*Since full moral causality belongs only to*personal*agents, not artificial ones, it is crucial to be able to identify and define who bears responsibility for the processes involved in AI, particularly those capable of learning, correction, and reprogramming. While bottom-up approaches and very deep neural networks enable AI to solve complex problems, they make it difficult to understand the processes that lead to the solutions they adopted. This complicates accountability since if an AI application produces undesired outcomes, determining who is responsible becomes difficult. To address this problem, attention needs to be given to the nature of*accountability*processes in complex, highly automated settings, where results may only become evident in the medium to long term. For this, it is important that ultimate responsibility for decisions made using AI rests with the human decision-makers and that there is accountability for the use of AI at each stage of the decision-making process.[[91]](#_ftn91)\n45. In addition to determining who is responsible, it is essential to identify the objectives given to AI systems. Although these systems may use unsupervised autonomous learning mechanisms and sometimes follow paths that humans cannot reconstruct, they ultimately pursue goals that humans have assigned to them and are governed by processes established by their designers and programmers. Yet, this presents a challenge because, as AI models become increasingly capable of independent learning, the ability to maintain control over them to ensure that such applications serve human purposes may effectively diminish. This raises the critical question of how to ensure that AI systems are ordered for the good of people and not against them.\n46. While responsibility for the ethical use of AI systems starts with those who develop, produce, manage, and oversee such systems, it is also shared by those who use them. As Pope Francis noted, the machine &#8220;makes a technical choice among several possibilities based either on well-defined criteria or on statistical inferences. Human beings, however, not only choose, but in their hearts are capable of deciding.&#8221;[[92]](#_ftn92)Those who use AI to accomplish a task and follow its results create a context in which they are ultimately responsible for the power they have delegated. Therefore, insofar as AI can assist humans in making decisions, the algorithms that govern it should be trustworthy, secure, robust enough to handle inconsistencies, and transparent in their operation to mitigate biases and unintended side effects.[[93]](#_ftn93)Regulatory frameworks should ensure that all legal entities remain accountable for the use of AI and all its consequences, with appropriate safeguards for transparency, privacy, and accountability.[[94]](#_ftn94)Moreover, those using AI should be careful not to become overly dependent on it for their decision-making, a trend that increases contemporary society&#8217;&#8217;s already high reliance on technology.\n47. The Church&#8217;s moral and social teaching provides resources to help ensure that AI is used in a way that preserves human agency. Considerations about justice, for example, should also address issues such as fostering just social dynamics, upholding international security, and promoting peace. By exercising prudence, individuals and communities can discern ways to use AI to benefit humanity while avoiding applications that could degrade human dignity or harm the environment. In this context, the concept of responsibility should be understood not only in its most limited sense but as a &#8220;responsibility for the care for others, which is more than simply accounting for results achieved.&#8221;[[95]](#_ftn95)\n48. Therefore, AI, like any technology, can be part of a conscious and responsible answer to humanity&#8217;s vocation to the good. However, as previously discussed, AI must be directed by human intelligence**to align with this vocation, ensuring it respects the dignity of the human person. Recognizing this &#8220;exalted dignity,&#8221; the Second Vatican Council affirmed that &#8220;the social order and its development must invariably work to the benefit of the human person.&#8221;[[96]](#_ftn96)In light of this, the use of AI, as Pope Francis said, must be &#8220;&#8220;accompanied by an ethic inspired by a vision of the common good, an ethic of freedom, responsibility, and fraternity, capable of fostering the full development of people in relation to others and to the whole of creation.&#8221;&#8221;[[97]](#_ftn97)\nV.**Specific Questions**\n49. Within this general perspective, some observations follow below to illustrate how the preceding arguments can help provide an ethical orientation in practical situations, in line with the &#8220;wisdom of heart&#8221; that Pope Francis has proposed.[[98]](#_ftn98)While not exhaustive, this discussion is offered in service of the dialogue that considers how AI can be used to uphold the dignity of the human person and promote the common good.[[99]](#_ftn99)\n*AI and Society*\n50. As Pope Francis observed, &#8220;the inherent dignity of each human being and the fraternity that binds us together as members of the one human family must undergird the development of new technologies and serve as indisputable criteria for evaluating them before they are employed.&#8221;[[100]](#_ftn100)\n51. Viewed through this lens, AI could &#8220;introduce important innovations in agriculture, education and culture, an improved level of life for entire nations and peoples, and the growth of human fraternity and social friendship,&#8221; and thus be &#8220;used to promote integral human development.&#8221;[[101]](#_ftn101)AI could also help organizations identify those in need and counter discrimination and marginalization. These and other similar applications of this technology could contribute to human development and the common good.[[102]](#_ftn102)\n52. However, while AI holds many possibilities for promoting the good, it can also hinder or even counter human development and the common good. Pope Francis has noted that &#8220;evidence to date suggests that digital technologies have increased inequality in our world. Not just differences in material wealth, which are also significant, but also differences in access to political and social influence.&#8221;[[103]](#_ftn103)In this sense, AI could be used to perpetuate marginalization and discrimination, create new forms of poverty, widen the &#8220;&#8220;digital divide,&#8221;&#8221; and worsen existing social inequalities.[[104]](#_ftn104)\n53. Moreover, the concentration of the power over mainstream AI applications in the hands of a few powerful companies raises significant ethical concerns. Exacerbating this problem is the inherent nature of AI systems, where no single individual can exercise complete oversight over the vast and complex datasets used for computation. This lack of well-defined accountability creates the risk that AI could be manipulated for personal or corporate gain or to direct public opinion for the benefit of a specific industry. Such entities, motivated by their own interests, possess the capacity to exercise &#8220;forms of control as subtle as they are invasive, creating mechanisms for the manipulation of consciences and of the democratic process.&#8221;[[105]](#_ftn105)\n54. Furthermore, there is the risk of AI being used to promote what Pope Francis has called the &#8220;&#8220;technocratic paradigm,&#8221;&#8221; which perceives all the world&#8217;&#8217;s problems as solvable through technological means alone.[[106]](#_ftn106)In this paradigm, human dignity and fraternity are often set aside in the name of efficiency, &#8220;&#8220;as if reality, goodness, and truth automatically flow from technological and economic power as such.&#8221;&#8221;[[107]](#_ftn107)Yet, human dignity and the common good must never be violated for the sake of efficiency,[[108]](#_ftn108)for &#8220;&#8220;technological developments that do not lead to an improvement in the quality of life of all humanity, but on the contrary, aggravate inequalities and conflicts, can never count as true progress.&#8221;&#8221;[[109]](#_ftn109)Instead, AI should be put &#8220;&#8220;at the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral.&#8221;&#8221;[[110]](#_ftn110)\n55. Achieving this objective requires a deeper reflection on the relationship between autonomy and responsibility. Greater autonomy heightens each person&#8217;s responsibility across various aspects of communal life. For Christians, the foundation of this responsibility lies in the recognition that all human capacities, including the person&#8217;s autonomy, come from God and are meant to be used in the service of others.[[111]](#_ftn111)Therefore, rather than merely pursuing economic or technological objectives, AI should serve &#8220;&#8220;the common good of the entire human family,&#8221;&#8221; which is &#8220;&#8220;the sum total of social conditions that allow people, either as groups or as individuals, to reach their fulfillment more fully and more easily.&#8221;&#8221;[[112]](#_ftn112)\n*AI and Human Relationships*\n56. The Second Vatican Council observed that &#8220;by his innermost nature man is a social being; and if he does not enter into relations with others, he can neither live nor develop his gifts.&#8221;[[113]](#_ftn113)This conviction underscores that living in society is intrinsic to the nature and vocation of the human person.[[114]](#_ftn114)As social beings, we seek relationships that involve mutual exchange and the pursuit of truth, in the course of which, people &#8220;&#8220;share with each other the truth they have discovered, or think they have discovered, in such a way that they help one another in the search for truth.&#8221;&#8221;[[115]](#_ftn115)\n57. Such a quest, along with other aspects of human communication, presupposes encounters and mutual exchange between individuals shaped by their unique histories, thoughts, convictions, and relationships. Nor can we forget that human intelligence is a diverse, multifaceted, and complex reality: individual and social, rational and affective, conceptual and symbolic. Pope Francis underscores this dynamic, noting that &#8220;&#8220;together, we can seek the truth in dialogue, in relaxed conversation or in passionate debate. To do so calls for perseverance; it entails moments of silence and suffering, yet it can patiently embrace the broader experience of individuals and peoples. [&#8230;&#8230;] The process of building fraternity, be it local or universal, can only be undertaken by spirits that are free and open to authentic encounters.&#8221;&#8221;[[116]](#_ftn116)\n58. It is in this context that one can consider the challenges AI poses to human relationships. Like other technological tools, AI has the potential to foster connections within the human family. However, it could also hinder a true encounter with reality and, ultimately, lead people to &#8220;a deep and melancholic dissatisfaction with interpersonal relations, or a harmful sense of isolation.&#8221;[[117]](#_ftn117)Authentic human relationships require the richness of being with others in their pain, their pleas, and their joy.[[118]](#_ftn118)Since human intelligence is expressed and enriched also in interpersonal and embodied ways, authentic and spontaneous encounters with others are indispensable for engaging with reality in its fullness.\n59. Because &#8220;true wisdom demands an encounter with reality,&#8221;[[119]](#_ftn119)the rise of AI introduces another challenge. Since AI can effectively imitate the products of human intelligence, the ability to know when one is interacting with a human or a machine can no longer be taken for granted. Generative AI can produce text, speech, images, and other advanced outputs that are usually associated with human beings. Yet, it must be understood for what it is: a tool, not a person.[[120]](#_ftn120)This distinction is often obscured by the language used by practitioners, which tends to anthropomorphize AI and thus blurs the line between human and machine.\n60. Anthropomorphizing AI also poses specific challenges for the development of children, potentially encouraging them to develop patterns of interaction that treat human relationships in a transactional manner, as one would relate to a chatbot. Such habits could lead young people to see teachers as mere dispensers of information rather than as mentors who guide and nurture their intellectual and moral growth. Genuine relationships, rooted in empathy and a steadfast commitment to the good of the other, are essential and irreplaceable in fostering the full development of the human person.\n61. In this context, it is important to clarify that, despite the use of anthropomorphic language, no AI application can genuinely experience empathy. Emotions cannot be reduced to facial expressions or phrases generated in response to prompts; they reflect the way a person, as a whole, relates to the world and to his or her own life, with the body playing a central role. True empathy requires the ability to listen, recognize another&#8217;s irreducible uniqueness, welcome their otherness, and grasp the meaning behind even their silences.[[121]](#_ftn121)Unlike the realm of analytical judgment in which AI excels, true empathy belongs to the relational sphere. It involves intuiting and apprehending the lived experiences of another while maintaining the distinction between self and other.[[122]](#_ftn122)While AI can simulate empathetic responses, it cannot replicate the eminently personal and relational nature of authentic empathy.[[123]](#_ftn123)\n62. In light of the above, it is clear why misrepresenting AI as a person should always be avoided; doing so for fraudulent purposes is a grave ethical violation that could erode social trust. Similarly, using AI to deceive in other contexts&#8212;such as in education or in human relationships, including the sphere of sexuality&#8212;is also to be considered immoral and requires careful oversight to prevent harm, maintain transparency, and ensure the dignity of allpeople.[[124]](#_ftn124)\n63. In an increasingly isolated world, some people have turned to AI in search of deep human relationships, simple companionship, or even emotional bonds. However, while human beings are meant to experience authentic relationships, AI can only simulate them. Nevertheless, such relationships with others are an integral part of how a person grows to become who he or she is meant to be. If AI is used to help people foster genuine connections between people, it can contribute positively to the full realization of the person. Conversely, if we replace relationships with God and with others with interactions with technology, we risk replacing authentic relationality with a lifeless image (cf. Ps. 106:20; Rom. 1:22-23). Instead of retreating into artificial worlds, we are called to engage in a committed and intentional way with reality, especially by identifying with the poor and suffering, consoling those in sorrow, and forging bonds of communion with all.\n*AI, the Economy, and Labor*\n64. Due to its interdisciplinary nature, AI is being increasingly integrated into economic and financial systems. Significant investments are currently being made not only in the technology sector but also in energy, finance, and media, particularly in the areas of marketing and sales, logistics, technological innovation, compliance, and risk management. At the same time, AI&#8217;s applications in these areas have also highlighted its ambivalent nature, as a source of tremendous opportunities but also profound risks. A first real critical point in this area concerns the possibility that&#8212;due to the concentration of AI applications in the hands of a few corporations&#8212;only those large companies would benefit from the value created by AI rather than the businesses that use it.\n65. Other broader aspects of AI&#8217;s impact on the economic-financial sphere must also be carefully examined, particularly concerning the interaction between concrete reality and the digital world. One important consideration in this regard involves the coexistence of diverse and alternative forms of economic and financial institutions within a given context. This factor should be encouraged, as it can bring benefits in how it supports the real economy by fostering its development and stability, especially during times of crisis. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that digital realities, not restricted by any spatial bonds, tend to be more homogeneous and impersonal than communities rooted in a particular place and a specific history, with a common journey characterized by shared values and hopes, but also by inevitable disagreements and divergences. This diversity is an undeniable asset to a community&#8217;s economic life. Turning over the economy and finance entirely to digital technology would reduce this variety and richness. As a result, many solutions to economic problems that can be reached through natural dialogue between the involved parties may no longer be attainable in a world dominated by procedures and only the appearance of nearness.\n66. Another area where AI is already having a profound impact is the world of work. As in many other fields, AI is driving fundamental transformations across many professions, with a range of effects. On the one hand, it has the potential to enhance expertise and productivity, create new jobs, enable workers to focus on more innovative tasks, and open new horizons for creativity and innovation.\n67. However, while AI promises to boost productivity by taking over mundane tasks, it frequently forces workers to adapt to the speed and demands of machines rather than machines being designed to support those who work. As a result, contrary to the advertised benefits of AI, current approaches to the technology can paradoxically*deskill*workers, subject them to automated surveillance, and relegate them to rigid and repetitive tasks. The need to keep up with the pace of technology can erode workers&#8217; sense of agency and stifle the innovative abilities they are expected to bring to their work.[[125]](#_ftn125)\n68. AI is currently eliminating the need for some jobs that were once performed by humans. If AI is used to replace human workers rather than complement them, there is a &#8220;substantial risk of disproportionate benefit for the few at the price of the impoverishment of many.&#8221;[[126]](#_ftn126)Additionally, as AI becomes more powerful, there is an associated risk that human labor may lose its value in the economic realm. This is the logical consequence of the technocratic paradigm: a world of humanity enslaved to efficiency, where, ultimately, the cost of humanity must be cut. Yet, human lives are intrinsically valuable, independent of their economic output. Nevertheless, the &#8220;current model,&#8221; Pope Francis explains, &#8220;does not appear to favor an investment in efforts to help the slow, the weak, or the less talented to find opportunities in life.&#8221;[[127]](#_ftn127)In light of this, &#8220;we cannot allow a tool as powerful and indispensable as Artificial Intelligence to reinforce such a paradigm, but rather, we must make Artificial Intelligence a bulwark against its expansion.&#8221;[[128]](#_ftn128)\n69. It is important to remember that &#8220;the order of things must be subordinate to the order of persons, and not the other way around.&#8221;[[129]](#_ftn129)Human work must not only be at the service of profit but at &#8220;the service of the whole human person [&#8230;] taking into account the person&#8217;s material needs and the requirements of his or her intellectual, moral, spiritual, and religious life.&#8221;[[130]](#_ftn130)In this context, the Church recognizes that work is &#8220;not only a means of earning one&#8217;s daily bread&#8221; but is also &#8220;an essential dimension of social life&#8221; and &#8220;a means [&#8230;] of personal growth, the building of healthy relationships, self-expression and the exchange of gifts. Work gives us a sense of shared responsibility for the development of the world, and ultimately, for our life as a people.&#8221;[[131]](#_ftn131)\n70. Since work is a &#8220;&#8220;part of the meaning of life on this earth, a path to growth, human development and personal fulfillment,&#8221;&#8221; &#8220;&#8220;the goal should not be that technological progress increasingly replaces human work, for this would be detrimental to humanity&#8221;&#8221;[[132]](#_ftn132)&#8212;rather, it should promote human labor. Seen in this light, AI should assist, not replace, human judgment. Similarly, it must never degrade creativity or reduce workers to mere &#8220;cogs in a machine.&#8221; Therefore, &#8220;respect for the dignity of laborers and the importance of employment for the economic well-being of individuals, families, and societies, for job security and just wages, ought to be a high priority for the international community as these forms of technology penetrate more deeply into our workplaces.&#8221;[[133]](#_ftn133)\n*AI and Healthcare*\n71. As participants in God&#8217;s healing work, healthcare professionals have the vocation and responsibility to be &#8220;guardians and servants of human life.&#8221;[[134]](#_ftn134)Because of this, the healthcare profession carries an &#8220;intrinsic and undeniable ethical dimension,&#8221; recognized by the Hippocratic Oath, which obliges physicians and healthcare professionals to commit themselves to having &#8220;absolute respect for human life and its sacredness.&#8221;[[135]](#_ftn135)Following the example of the Good Samaritan, this commitment is to be carried out by men and women &#8220;who reject the creation of a society of exclusion, and act instead as neighbors, lifting up and rehabilitating the fallen for the sake of the common good.&#8221;[[136]](#_ftn136)\n72. Seen in this light, AI seems to hold immense potential in a variety of applications in the medical field, such as assisting the diagnostic work of healthcare providers, facilitating relationships between patients and medical staff, offering new treatments, and expanding access to quality care also for those who are isolated or marginalized. In these ways, the technology could enhance the &#8220;compassionate and loving closeness&#8221;[[137]](#_ftn137)that healthcare providers are called to extend to the sick and suffering.\n73. However, if AI is used not to enhance but to replace the relationship between patients and healthcare providers&#8212;leaving patients to interact with a machine rather than a human being&#8212;it would reduce a crucially important human relational structure to a centralized, impersonal, and unequal framework. Instead of encouraging solidarity with the sick and suffering, such applications of AI would risk worsening the loneliness that often accompanies illness, especially in the context of a culture where &#8220;persons are no longer seen as a paramount value to be cared for and respected.&#8221;[[138]](#_ftn138)This misuse of AI would not align with respect for the dignity of the human person and solidarity with the suffering.\n74. Responsibility for the well-being of patients and the decisions that touch upon their lives are at the heart of the healthcare profession. This accountability requires medical professionals to exercise all their skill and intelligence in making well-reasoned and ethically grounded choices regarding those entrusted to their care, always respecting the inviolable dignity of the patients and the need for informed consent. As a result, decisions regarding patient treatment and the weight of responsibility they entail must always remain with the human person and should never be delegated to AI.[[139]](#_ftn139)\n75. In addition, using AI to determine who should receive treatment based predominantly on economic measures or metrics of efficiency represents a particularly problematic instance of the &#8220;technocratic paradigm&#8221; that must be rejected.[[140]](#_ftn140)For, &#8220;optimizing resources means using them in an ethical and fraternal way, and not penalizing the most fragile.&#8221;[[141]](#_ftn141)Additionally, AI tools in healthcare are &#8220;exposed to forms of bias and discrimination,&#8221; where &#8220;systemic errors can easily multiply, producing not only injustices in individual cases but also, due to the domino effect, real forms of social inequality.&#8221;[[142]](#_ftn142)\n76. The integration of AI into healthcare also poses the risk of amplifying other existing disparities in access to medical care. As healthcare becomes increasingly oriented toward prevention and lifestyle-based approaches, AI-driven solutions may inadvertently favor more affluent populations who already enjoy better access to medical resources and quality nutrition. This trend risks reinforcing a &#8220;medicine for the rich&#8221; model, where those with financial means benefit from advanced preventative tools and personalized health information while others struggle to access even basic services. To prevent such inequities, equitable frameworks are needed to ensure that the use of AI in healthcare does not worsen existing healthcare inequalities but rather serves the common good.\n*AI and Education*\n77. The words of the Second Vatican Council remain fully relevant today: &#8220;True education strives to form individuals with a view toward their final end and the good of the society to which they belong.&#8221;[[143]](#_ftn143)As such, education is &#8220;never a mere process of passing on facts and intellectual skills: rather, its aim is to contribute to the person&#8217;s holistic formation in its various aspects (intellectual, cultural, spiritual, etc.), including, for example, community life and relations within the academic community,&#8221;[[144]](#_ftn144)in keeping with the nature and dignity of the human person.\n78. This approach involves a commitment to cultivating the mind, but always as a part of the integral development of the person: &#8220;We must break that idea of education which holds that educating means filling one&#8217;s head with ideas. That is the way we educate automatons, cerebral minds, not people. Educating is taking a risk in the tension between the mind, the heart, and the hands.&#8221;[[145]](#_ftn145)\n79. At the center of this work of forming the whole human person is the indispensable relationship between teacher and student. Teachers do more than convey knowledge; they model essential human qualities and inspire the joy of discovery.[[146]](#_ftn146)Their presence motivates students both through the content they teach and the care they demonstrate for their students. This bond fosters trust, mutual understanding, and the capacity to address each person&#8217;s unique dignity and potential. On the part of the student, this can generate a genuine desire to grow. The physical presence of a teacher creates a relational dynamic that AI cannot replicate, one that deepens engagement and nurtures the student&#8217;s integral development.\n80. In this context, AI presents both opportunities and challenges. If used in a prudent manner, within the context of an existing teacher-student relationship and ordered to the authentic goals of education, AI can become a valuable educational resource by enhancing access to education, offering tailored support, and providing immediate feedback to students. These benefits could enhance the learning experience, especially in cases where individualized attention is needed, or educational resources are otherwise scarce.\n81. Nevertheless, an essential part of education is forming &#8220;the intellect to reason well in all matters, to reach out towards truth, and to grasp it,&#8221;[[147]](#_ftn147)while helping the &#8220;language of the head&#8221; to grow harmoniously with the &#8220;language of the heart&#8221; and the &#8220;language of the hands.&#8221;[[148]](#_ftn148)This is all the more vital in an age marked by technology, in which &#8220;it is no longer merely a question of &#8216;using&#8217; instruments of communication, but of living in a highly digitalized culture that has had a profound impact on [&#8230;] our ability to communicate, learn, be informed and enter into relationship with others.&#8221;[[149]](#_ftn149)However, instead of fostering &#8220;a cultivated intellect,&#8221; which &#8220;brings with it a power and a grace to every work and occupation that it undertakes,&#8221;[[150]](#_ftn150)the extensive use of AI in education could lead to the students&#8217; increased reliance on technology, eroding their ability to perform some skills independently and worsening their dependence on screens.[[151]](#_ftn151)\n82. Additionally, while some AI systems are designed to help people develop their critical thinking abilities and problem-solving skills, many others merely provide answers instead of prompting students to arrive at answers themselves or write text for themselves.[[152]](#_ftn152)Instead of training young people how to amass information and generate quick responses, education should encourage &#8220;&#8220;the responsible use of freedom to face issues with good sense and intelligence.&#8221;&#8221;[[153]](#_ftn153)Building on this, &#8220;&#8220;education in the use of forms of artificial intelligence should aim above all at promoting critical thinking. Users of all ages, but especially the young, need to develop a discerning approach to the use of data and content collected on the web or produced by artificial intelligence systems. Schools, universities, and scientific societies are challenged to help students and professionals to grasp the social and ethical aspects of the development and uses of technology.&#8221;&#8221;[[154]](#_ftn154)\n83. As Saint John Paul II recalled, &#8220;in the world today, characterized by such rapid developments in science and technology, the tasks of a Catholic University assume an ever greater importance and urgency.&#8221;[[155]](#_ftn155)In a particular way, Catholic universities are urged to be present as great laboratories of hope at this crossroads of history. In an inter-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary key, they are urged to engage &#8220;&#8220;with wisdom and creativity&#8221;&#8221;[[156]](#_ftn156)in careful research on this phenomenon, helping to draw out the salutary potential within the various fields of science and reality, and guiding them always towards ethically sound applications that clearly serve the cohesion of our societies and the common good, reaching new frontiers in the dialogue between faith and reason.\n84. Moreover, it should be noted that current AI programs have been known to provide biased or fabricated information, which can lead students to trust inaccurate content. This problem &#8220;not only runs the risk of legitimizing fake news and strengthening a dominant culture&#8217;s advantage, but, in short, it also undermines the educational process itself.&#8221;[[157]](#_ftn157)With time, clearer distinctions may emerge between proper and improper uses of AI in education and research. Yet, a decisive guideline is that the use of AI should always be transparent and never misrepresented.\n*AI, Misinformation, Deepfakes, and Abuse*\n85. AI could be used as an aid to human dignity if it helps people understand complex concepts or directs them to sound resources that support their search for the truth.[[158]](#_ftn158)\n86. However, AI also presents a serious risk of generating manipulated content and false information, which can easily mislead people due to its resemblance to the truth. Such misinformation might occur unintentionally, as in the case of AI &#8220;hallucination,&#8221; where a generative AI system yields results that appear real but are not. Since generating content that mimics human artifacts is central to AI&#8217;s functionality, mitigating these risks proves challenging. Yet, the consequences of such aberrations and false information can be quite grave. For this reason, all those involved in producing and using AI systems should be committed to the truthfulness and accuracy of the information processed by such systems and disseminated to the public.\n87. While AI has a latent potential to generate false information, an even more troubling problem lies in the deliberate misuse of AI for manipulation. This can occur when individuals or organizations intentionally generate and spread false content with the aim to deceive or cause harm, such as &#8220;deepfake&#8221; images, videos, and audio&#8212;referring to a false depiction of a person, edited or generated by an AI algorithm. The danger of deepfakes is particularly evident when they are used to target or harm others. While the images or videos themselves may be artificial, the damage they cause is real, leaving &#8220;deep scars in the hearts of those who suffer it&#8221; and &#8220;real wounds in their human dignity.&#8221;[[159]](#_ftn159)\n88. On a broader scale, by distorting &#8220;our relationship with others and with reality,&#8221;[[160]](#_ftn160)AI-generated fake media can gradually undermine the foundations of society. This issue requires careful regulation, as misinformation&#8212;&#8212;especially through AI-controlled or influenced media&#8212;&#8212;can spread unintentionally, fueling political polarization and social unrest. When society becomes indifferent to the truth, various groups construct their own versions of &#8220;&#8220;facts,&#8221;&#8221; weakening the &#8220;&#8220;reciprocal ties and mutual dependencies&#8221;&#8221;[[161]](#_ftn161)that underpin the fabric of social life. As deepfakes cause people to question everything and AI-generated false content erodes trust in what they see and****hear, polarization and conflict will only grow. Such widespread deception is no trivial matter; it strikes at the core of humanity, dismantling the foundational trust on which societies are built.[[162]](#_ftn162)\n89. Countering AI-driven falsehoods is not only the work of industry experts&#8212;it requires the efforts of all people of goodwill. &#8220;If technology is to serve human dignity and not harm it, and if it is to promote peace rather than violence, then the human community must be proactive in addressing these trends with respect to human dignity and the promotion of the good.&#8221;[[163]](#_ftn163)Those who produce and share AI-generated content should always exercise diligence in verifying the truth of what they disseminate and, in all cases, should &#8220;&#8220;avoid the sharing of words and images that are degrading of human beings, that promote hatred and intolerance, that debase the goodness and intimacy of human sexuality or that exploit the weak and vulnerable.&#8221;&#8221;[[164]](#_ftn164)This calls for the ongoing prudence and careful discernment of all users regarding their activity online.[[165]](#_ftn165)\n*AI, Privacy, and Surveillance*\n90. Humans are inherently relational, and the data each person generates in the digital world can be seen as an objectified expression of this relational nature. Data conveys not only information but also personal and relational knowledge, which, in an increasingly digitized context, can amount to power over the individual. Moreover, while some types of data may pertain to public aspects of a person&#8217;&#8217;s life, others may touch upon the individual&#8217;&#8217;s interiority, perhaps even their conscience. Seen in this way, privacy plays an essential role in protecting the boundaries of a person&#8217;&#8217;s inner life, preserving their freedom to relate to others, express themselves, and make decisions without undue control. This protection is also tied to the defense of religious freedom, as surveillance can also be misused to exert control over the lives of believers and how they express their faith.\n91. It is appropriate, therefore, to address the issue of privacy from a concern for the legitimate freedom and inalienable dignity of the human person &#8220;in all circumstances.&#8221;[[166]](#_ftn166)The Second Vatican Council included the right &#8220;to safeguard privacy&#8221; among the fundamental rights &#8220;necessary for living a genuinely human life,&#8221; a right that should be extended to all people on account of their &#8220;sublime dignity.&#8221;[[167]](#_ftn167)Furthermore, the Church has also affirmed the right to the legitimate respect for a private life in the context of affirming the person&#8217;s right to a good reputation, defense of their physical and mental integrity, and freedom from harm or undue intrusion[[168]](#_ftn168)&#8212;essential components of the due respect for the intrinsic dignity of the human person.[[169]](#_ftn169)\n92. Advances in AI-powered data processing and analysis now make it possible to infer patterns in a person&#8217;s behavior and thinking from even a small amount of information, making the role of data privacy even more imperative as a safeguard for the dignity and relational nature of the human person. As Pope Francis observed, &#8220;while closed and intolerant attitudes towards others are on the rise, distances are otherwise shrinking or disappearing to the point that the right to privacy scarcely exists. Everything has become a kind of spectacle to be examined and inspected, and people&#8217;s lives are now under constant surveillance.&#8221;[[170]](#_ftn170)\n93. While there can be legitimate and proper ways to use AI in keeping with human dignity and the common good, using it for surveillance aimed at exploiting, restricting others&#8217; freedom, or benefitting a few at the expense of the many is unjustifiable. The risk of surveillance overreach must be monitored by appropriate regulators to ensure transparency and public accountability. Those responsible for surveillance should never exceed their authority, which must always favor the dignity and freedom of every person as the essential basis of a just and humane society.\n94. Furthermore, &#8220;fundamental respect for human dignity demands that we refuse to allow the uniqueness of the person to be identified with a set of data.&#8221;[[171]](#_ftn171)This especially applies when AI is used to evaluate individuals or groups based on their behavior, characteristics, or history&#8212;a practice known as &#8220;social scoring&#8221;: &#8220;In social and economic decision-making, we should be cautious about delegating judgments to algorithms that process data, often collected surreptitiously, on an individual&#8217;s makeup and prior behavior. Such data can be contaminated by societal prejudices and preconceptions. A person&#8217;s past behavior should not be used to deny him or her the opportunity to change, grow, and contribute to society. We cannot allow algorithms to limit or condition respect for human dignity, or to exclude compassion, mercy, forgiveness, and above all, the hope that people are able to change.&#8221;[[172]](#_ftn172)\n*AI and the Protectionof Our Common Home*\n95. AI has many promising applications for improving our relationship with our &#8220;common home,&#8221; such as creating models to forecast extreme climate events, proposing engineering solutions to reduce their impact, managing relief operations, and predicting population shifts.[[173]](#_ftn173)Additionally, AI can support sustainable agriculture, optimize energy usage, and provide early warning systems for public health emergencies. These advancements have the potential to strengthen resilience against climate-related challenges and promote more sustainable development.\n96. At the same time, current AI models and the hardware required to support them consume vast amounts of energy and water, significantly contributing to CO2emissions and straining resources. This reality is often obscured by the way this technology is presented in the popular imagination, where words such as &#8220;the cloud&#8221;[[174]](#_ftn174)can give the impression that data is stored and processed in an intangible realm, detached from the physical world. However, &#8220;&#8220;the cloud&#8221;&#8221; is not an ethereal domain separate from the physical world; as with all computing technologies, it relies on physical machines, cables, and energy. The same is true of the technology behind AI. As these systems grow in complexity, especially large language models (LLMs), they require ever-larger datasets, increased computational power, and greater storage infrastructure. Considering the heavy toll these technologies take on the environment, it is vital to develop sustainable solutions that reduce their impact on our common home.\n97. Even then, as Pope Francis teaches, it is essential &#8220;&#8220;that we look for solutions not only in technology but in a change of humanity.&#8221;&#8221;[[175]](#_ftn175)A complete and authentic understanding of creation recognizes that the value of all created things cannot be reduced to their mere utility. Therefore, a fully human approach to the stewardship of the earth rejects the distorted anthropocentrism of the technocratic paradigm, which seeks to &#8220;extract everything possible&#8221; from the world,[[176]](#_ftn176)and rejects the &#8220;myth of progress,&#8221; which assumes that &#8220;ecological problems will solve themselves simply with the application of new technology and without any need for ethical considerations or deep change.&#8221;[[177]](#_ftn177)Such a mindset must give way to a more holistic approach that respects the order of creation and promotes the integral good of the human person while safeguarding our common home.[[178]](#_ftn178)\n*AI and Warfare*\n98. The Second Vatican Council and the consistent teaching of the Popes since then have insisted that peace is not merely the absence of war and is not limited to maintaining a balance of powers between adversaries. Instead, in the words of Saint Augustine, peace is &#8220;the tranquility of order.&#8221;[[179]](#_ftn179)Indeed, peace cannot be attained without safeguarding the goods of persons, free communication, respect for the dignity of persons and peoples, and the assiduous practice of fraternity. Peace is the work of justice and the effect of charity and cannot be achieved through force alone; instead, it must be principally built through patient diplomacy, the active promotion of justice, solidarity, integral human development, and respect for the dignity of all people.[[180]](#_ftn180)In this way, the tools used to maintain peace should never be allowed to justify injustice, violence, or oppression. Instead, they should always be governed by a &#8220;&#8220;firm determination to respect other people and nations, along with their dignity, as well as the deliberate practice of fraternity.&#8221;&#8221;[[181]](#_ftn181)\n99. While AI&#8217;s analytical abilities could help nations seek peace and ensure security, the &#8220;weaponization of Artificial Intelligence&#8221; can also be highly problematic. Pope Francis has observed that &#8220;the ability to conduct military operations through remote control systems has led to a lessened perception of the devastation caused by those weapon systems and the burden of responsibility for their use, resulting in an even more cold and detached approach to the immense tragedy of war.&#8221;[[182]](#_ftn182)Moreover, the ease with which autonomous weapons make war more viable militates against the principle of war as a last resort in legitimate self-defense,[[183]](#_ftn183)potentially increasing the instruments of war well beyond the scope of human oversight and precipitating a destabilizing arms race, with catastrophic consequences for human rights.[[184]](#_ftn184)\n100. In particular, Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems, which are capable of identifying and striking targets without direct human intervention, are a &#8220;cause for grave ethical concern&#8221; because they lack the &#8220;unique human capacity for moral judgment and ethical decision-making.&#8221;[[185]](#_ftn185)For this reason, Pope Francis has urgently called for a reconsideration of the development of these weapons and a prohibition on their use, starting with &#8220;&#8220;an effective and concrete commitment to introduce ever greater and proper human control. No machine should ever choose to take the life of a human being.&#8221;&#8221;[[186]](#_ftn186)\n101. Since it is a small step from machines that can kill autonomously with precision to those capable of large-scale destruction, some AI researchers have expressed concerns that such technology poses an &#8220;existential risk&#8221; by having the potential to act in ways that could threaten the survival of entire regions or even of humanity itself. This danger demands serious attention, reflecting the long-standing concern about technologies that grant war &#8220;an uncontrollable destructive power over great numbers of innocent civilians,&#8221;[[187]](#_ftn187)without even sparing children. In this context, the call from*[Gaudium et Spes](https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html)*to &#8220;undertake an evaluation of war with an entirely new attitude&#8221;[[188]](#_ftn188)is more urgent than ever.\n102. At the same time, while the theoretical risks of AI deserve attention, the more immediate and pressing concern lies in how individuals with malicious intentions might misuse this technology.[[189]](#_ftn189)Like any tool, AI is an extension of human power, and while its future capabilities are unpredictable, humanity&#8217;&#8217;s past actions provide clear warnings. The atrocities committed throughout history are enough to raise deep concerns about the potential abuses of AI.\n103. Saint John Paul II observed that &#8220;humanity now has instruments of unprecedented power: we can turn this world into a garden, or reduce it to a pile of rubble.&#8221;[[190]](#_ftn190)Given this fact, the Church reminds us, in the words of Pope Francis, that &#8220;&#8220;we are free to apply our intelligence towards things evolving positively,&#8221;&#8221; or toward &#8220;&#8220;decadence and mutual destruction.&#8221;&#8221;[[191]](#_ftn191)To prevent humanity from spiraling into self-destruction,[[192]](#_ftn192)there must be a clear stand against all applications of technology that inherently threaten human life and dignity. This commitment requires careful discernment about the use of AI, particularly in military defense applications, to ensure that it always respects human dignity and serves the common good. The development and deployment of AI in armaments should be subject to the highest levels of ethical scrutiny, governed by a concern for human dignity and the sanctity of life.[[193]](#_ftn193)\n*AI and OurRelationship with God*\n104. Technology offers remarkable tools to oversee and develop the world&#8217;s resources. However, in some cases, humanity is increasingly ceding control of these resources to machines. Within some circles of scientists and futurists, there is optimism about the potential of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a hypothetical form of AI that would match or surpass human intelligence and bring about unimaginable advancements. Some even speculate that AGI could achieve superhuman capabilities. At the same time, as society drifts away from a connection with the transcendent, some are tempted to turn to AI in search of meaning or fulfillment&#8212;longings that can only be truly satisfied in communion with God.[[194]](#_ftn194)\n105. However,*the presumption of substituting God for an artifact of human making is idolatry*, a practice Scripture explicitly warns against (e.g., Ex. 20:4; 32:1-5; 34:17). Moreover, AI may prove even more seductive than traditional idols for, unlike idols that &#8220;have mouths but do not speak; eyes, but do not see; ears, but do not hear&#8221; (Ps. 115:5-6), AI can &#8220;speak,&#8221; or at least gives the illusion of doing so (cf. Rev. 13:15). Yet, it is vital to remember that AI is but a pale reflection of humanity&#8212;it is crafted by human minds, trained on human-generated material, responsive to human input, and sustained through human labor. AI cannot possess many of the capabilities specific to human life, and it is also fallible. By turning to AI as a perceived &#8220;Other&#8221; greater than itself, with which to share existence and responsibilities, humanity risks creating a substitute for God. However, it is not AI that is ultimately deified and worshipped, but humanity itself&#8212;which, in this way, becomes enslaved to its own work.[[195]](#_ftn195)\n106. While AI has the potential to serve humanity and contribute to the common good, it remains a creation of human hands, bearing &#8220;the imprint of human art and ingenuity&#8221; (Acts 17:29). It must never be ascribed undue worth. As the Book of Wisdom affirms: &#8220;For a man made them, and one whose spirit is borrowed formed them; for no man can form a god which is like himself. He is mortal, and what he makes with lawless hands is dead, for he is better than the objects he worships since he has life, but they never have&#8221; (Wis. 15:16-17).\n107. In contrast, human beings, &#8220;by their interior life, transcend the entire material universe; they experience this deep interiority when they enter into their own heart, where God, who probes the heart, awaits them, and where they decide their own destiny in the sight of God.&#8221;[[196]](#_ftn196)It is within the heart, as Pope Francis reminds us, that each individual discovers the &#8220;mysterious connection between self-knowledge and openness to others, between the encounter with one&#8217;s personal uniqueness and the willingness to give oneself to others.&#8221;[[197]](#_ftn197)Therefore, it is the heart alone that is &#8220;capable of setting our other powers and passions, and our entire person, in a stance of reverence and loving obedience before the Lord,&#8221;[[198]](#_ftn198)who &#8220;offers to treat each one of us as a &#8216;Thou,&#8217; always and forever.&#8221;[[199]](#_ftn199)\nVI.**Concluding Reflections**\n108. Considering the various challenges posed by advances in technology, Pope Francis emphasized the need for growth in &#8220;human responsibility, values, and conscience,&#8221; proportionate to the growth in the potential that this technology brings[[200]](#_ftn200)&#8212;recognizing that &#8220;with an increase in human power comes a broadening of responsibility on the part of individuals and communities.&#8221;[[201]](#_ftn201)\n109. At the same time, the &#8220;essential and fundamental question&#8221; remains &#8220;whether in the context of this progress man, as man, is becoming truly better, that is to say, more mature spiritually, more aware of the dignity of his humanity, more responsible, more open to others, especially the neediest and the weakest, and readier to give and to aid all.&#8221;[[202]](#_ftn202)\n110. As a result, it is crucial to know how to evaluate individual applications of AI in particular contexts to determine whether its use promotes human dignity, the vocation of the human person, and the common good. As with many technologies, the effects of the various uses of AI may not always be predictable from their inception. As these applications and their social impacts become clearer, appropriate responses should be made at all levels of society, following the principle of subsidiarity. Individual users, families, civil society, corporations, institutions, governments, and international organizations should work at their proper levels to ensure that AI is used for the good of all.\n111. A significant challenge and opportunity for the common good today lies in considering AI within a framework of relational intelligence, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of individuals and communities and highlights our shared responsibility for fostering the integral well-being of others. The twentieth-century philosopher Nicholas Berdyaev observed that people often blame machines for personal and social problems; however, &#8220;this only humiliates man and does not correspond to his dignity,&#8221; for &#8220;it is unworthy to transfer responsibility from man to a machine.&#8221;[[203]](#_ftn203)Only the human person can be morally responsible, and the challenges of a technological society are ultimately*spiritual*in nature. Therefore, facing those challenges &#8220;demands an intensification of spirituality.&#8221;[[204]](#_ftn204)\n112. A further point to consider is the call, prompted by the appearance of AI on the world stage, for a*renewed appreciation of all that is human*. Years ago, the French Catholic author Georges Bernanos warned that &#8220;the danger is not in the multiplication of machines, but in the ever-increasing number of men accustomed from their childhood to desire only what machines can give.&#8221;[[205]](#_ftn205)This challenge is as true today as it was then, as the rapid pace of digitization risks a &#8220;digital reductionism,&#8221; where non-quantifiable aspects of life are set aside and then forgotten or even deemed irrelevant because they cannot be computed in formal terms. AI should be used only as a tool to complement human intelligence rather than replace its richness.[[206]](#_ftn206)Cultivating those aspects of human life that transcend computation is crucial for preserving &#8220;an authentic humanity&#8221; that &#8220;seems to dwell in the midst of our technological culture, almost unnoticed, like a mist seeping gently beneath a closed door.&#8221;[[207]](#_ftn207)\n*True Wisdom*\n113. The vast expanse of the world&#8217;s knowledge is now accessible in ways that would have filled past generations with awe. However, to ensure that advancements in knowledge do not become humanly or spiritually barren, one must go beyond the mere accumulation of data and strive to achieve true wisdom.[[208]](#_ftn208)\n114. This wisdom is the gift that humanity needs most to address the profound questions and ethical challenges posed by AI: &#8220;Only by adopting a spiritual way of viewing reality, only by recovering a wisdom of the heart, can we confront and interpret the newness of our time.&#8221;[[209]](#_ftn209)Such &#8220;&#8220;wisdom of the heart&#8221;&#8221; is &#8220;&#8220;the virtue that enables us to integrate the whole and its parts, our decisions and their consequences.&#8221;&#8221; It &#8220;&#8220;cannot be sought from machines,&#8221;&#8221; but it &#8220;&#8220;lets itself be found by those who seek it and be seen by those who love it; it anticipates those who desire it, and it goes in search of those who are worthy of it (cf. Wis 6:12-16).&#8221;&#8221;[[210]](#_ftn210)\n115. In a world marked by AI, we need the grace of the Holy Spirit, who &#8220;enables us to look at things with God&#8217;s eyes, to see connections, situations, events and to uncover their real meaning.&#8221;[[211]](#_ftn211)\n116. Since a &#8220;person&#8217;s perfection is measured not by the information or knowledge they possess, but by the depth of their charity,&#8221;[[212]](#_ftn212)how we incorporate AI &#8220;&#8220;to include the least of our brothers and sisters, the vulnerable, and those most in need, will be the true measure of our humanity.&#8221;&#8221;[[213]](#_ftn213)The &#8220;&#8220;wisdom of the heart&#8221;&#8221; can illuminate and guide the human-centered use of this technology to help promote the common good, care for our &#8220;&#8220;common home,&#8221;&#8221; advance the search for the truth, foster integral human development, favor human solidarity and fraternity, and lead humanity to its ultimate goal: happiness and full communion with God.[[214]](#_ftn214)\n117. From this perspective of wisdom, believers will be able to act as moral agents capable of using this technology to promote an authentic vision of the human person and society.[[215]](#_ftn215)This should be done with the understanding that technological progress is part of God&#8217;&#8217;s plan for creation&#8212;&#8212;an activity that we are called to order toward the Paschal Mystery of Jesus Christ, in the continual search for the True and the Good.\n*The Supreme Pontiff, Francis, at the Audience granted on 14 January 2025 to the undersigned Prefects and Secretaries of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Dicastery for Culture and Education, approved this*Note*and ordered its publication.*\nGiven in Rome, at the offices of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Dicastery for Culture and Education, on 28 January 2025, the Liturgical Memorial of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Doctor of the Church.\nV&#xed;ctor Manuel Card.

Yet, this negative view of the body is inconsistent with a proper understanding of human dignity. While the Church supports genuine scientific progress, it affirms that human dignity is rooted in &#8220;the person as an inseparable unity of body and soul.&#8221; Thus, &#8220;dignity is also inherent in each person&#8217;s body, which participates in its own way in being*in**imago Dei*&#8221; (Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, Declaration*[Dignitas Infinita](https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_ddf_doc_20240402_dignitas-infinita_en.html)*[8 April 2024], par. 18).\n[[10]](#_ftnref10)This approach reflects a functionalist perspective, which reduces the human mind to its functions and assumes that its functions can be entirely quantified in physical or mathematical terms.

Similarly, if machines are said to operate using logical thinking, it must be specified that this is limited to computational logic. On the other hand, by its very nature, human thought is a creative process that eludes programming and transcends constraints.\n[[13]](#_ftnref13)On the foundational role of language in shaping understanding, cf.

Writing, for example, is often associated with the structuring of thinking. With GenAI [&#8230;], humans can now start with a well-structured outline provided by GenAI. Some experts have characterized the use of GenAI to generate text in this way as &#8216;writing without thinking&#8217;&#8221; (UNESCO,*Guidance for Generative AI in Education and Research*[2023], 37-38). The German-American philosopher Hannah Arendt foresaw such a possibility in her 1959 book,*The Human Condition*, and cautioned: &#8220;If it should turn out to be true that knowledge (in the sense of know-how) and thought have parted company for good, then we would indeed become the helpless slaves, not so much of our machines as of our know-how&#8221; (Id.,*The Human Condition*, University of Chicago Press, Chicago 20182, 3).\n[[153]](#_ftnref153)Francis, Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation*[Amoris Laetitia](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20160319_amoris-laetitia.html)*(19 March 2016), par. 262:*AAS*108 (2016), 417.\n[[154]](#_ftnref154)Francis,*[Message for the LVII World Day of Peace](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/messages/peace/documents/20231208-messaggio-57giornatamondiale-pace2024.html)*(1 January 2024), par. 7:*L&#8217;Osservatore Romano*, 14 December 2023, 3; cf.

When we have confirmed access, the full article content will load.\n\nThe parishioners at St. Matthias Schöneberg Church in Berlin worry about artificial intelligence.\n\nCongregants fret that their children are finding false information on chatbots or social media. Teachers at the parish school regularly monitor for A.I.-enabled cheating. And in this parish of 12,000 Catholics from more than 100 countries, those who make a living as interpreters fear their jobs will soon be obsolete.\n\nNow, they have an ally in the new pope.\n\nLess than a week into the role, Leo XIV has publicly highlighted his concerns about the rapidly advancing technology. In his [inaugural address to the College of Cardinals](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/10/world/europe/leo-xiv-pope-francis-catholic-church.html), he said the church would address the risks that artificial intelligence poses to “human dignity, justice and labor.” And in his [first speech to journalists](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/world/europe/pope-leo-vatican-journalists.html), he cited the “immense potential” of A.I. while warning that it requires responsibility “to ensure that it can be used for the good of all.”\n\nWhile it is far too early to say how Pope Leo will use his platform to address these concerns or [whether he can have much effect](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/world/asia/pope-leo-voice-platform.html), his focus on artificial intelligence shows he is a church leader who grasps the gravity of this modern issue.\n\nPaolo Benanti, a Franciscan friar, professor and [the Vatican’s top adviser on the ethics of artificial intelligence](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/09/world/europe/italy-artificial-intelligence-ethics.html), said he was surprised by Leo’s “bold” priorities.Father Benanti remembers that just 15 years ago, when he told his doctoral advisers that he wanted to study cyborgs and human enhancement at the Gregorian, the pontifical university where he now teaches, his advisers thought he was nuts.\n\n“And now it’s the first topic of a pope,” he said in an interview at his monastery this week.\n\nImage\n\nPaolo Benanti in Rome, last year.Credit...Alessandro Penso for The New York Times\n\nAs a cardinal and head of the Vatican office that selects and manages bishops around the world, Pope Leo was already thinking about artificial intelligence. Father Benanti said that last September, the future pope, who has a degree in mathematics, invited the friar to talk to the heads of other Vatican departments about how to deal with digital life generally, including A.I.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
