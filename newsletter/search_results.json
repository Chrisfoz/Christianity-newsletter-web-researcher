In this issue, you’ll read about how a monastery on Patmos offers quiet in a world of noise and, from Ann Voskamp, how God’s will is a place to find home. Read about modern missions terminology in our roundtable feature and about an astrophysicist’s thoughts on the Incarnation. Be sure to linger over Andy Olsen’s reported feature “An American Deportation” as we consider Christian responses to immigration policies. May we practice hospitality wherever we find ourselves.\n\nNovember/December 2025\n\n[View current issue](https://www.christianitytoday.com/magazine/2025/november-december/)\n\n[**The Incarnation Sheds Light on Astrophysics**](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/11/the-incarnation-sheds-light-on-astrophysics/)\n\n[Deborah Haarsma](https://www.christianitytoday.com/search/Deborah+Haarsma/)\n\n[**The Architecture of Revelation**](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/11/the-architecture-of-revelation/)\n\n[Kyle Dugdale](https://www.christianitytoday.com/search/Kyle+Dugdale/)\n\n[**Charity Begins with Zoning Reforms**](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/11/hospitality-begins-with-zoning-reforms/)\n\n[Mark D.

Gather25 will be a 25-hour event hosted both virtually and in person across six continents.\nAI translation technology will allow live music, teaching, prayers, and international stories of hope to be shared globally at the same time. Christians can join from their homes, theatres, local churches, or at one of the live broadcast sites.\nThe event is being supported by organisations such as YouVersion, The Bible Project, illumiNations and 24-7 Prayer International.\nJennie Allen, founder and visionary behind Gather25, said: \"For the first time in history, the entire Church is actually able to gather. We are inviting all 2.5 billion people who love Jesus to come together to pray, to see stories of the Church, and to commission them to become missionaries wherever they are to reach the ends of the earth.\"\nAllen told _Premier_ she was inspired to start the project after having a vision of the second coming: \"It was so vivid. I woke up and thought 'What would we do if he was coming back soon?' We'd bring everyone together across the world, and we would be on the same mission, the way that Jesus told us to be.\"\nDr Charles Mugisha is the co-founder of Africa New Life Ministries and lead pastor of New Life Bible Church Rwanda. He said: \"Gather25 is an opportunity for God's people to become one, with Christ at the centre.\n\"There are billions of people and many people groups, who don't know the love of God – my prayer is that Gather25 would ignite a new commissioning of the Church under the power of the Holy Spirit so that every soul would be reached with the love of God.\"\nThe event will take place on 1st March 2025.\n### A Monthly Gift Of $11 Makes A World Of Difference\nIn a world of fake news there’s never been a greater need for quality Christian journalism. Premier’s mission is to provide the Church with the most up to date and relevant news, told from a Christian perspective. But we can’t do it without you.\nUnlike many websites we haven't put up a paywall — we want to keep our journalism free at the point of need and as open as we can. Premier’s news output takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. No one in the USA is sharing news like we are across radio, magazines and online so please help us to continue that today.\nFor a monthly gift of $11 or more we’d also be able to send you a free copy of the brand new Premier Bible, a wonderful Anglicised version of the NLT packed with exclusive bonus content, reading plan and resources to help you get the most out of scripture.\n**Your monthly support will make a world of difference.
